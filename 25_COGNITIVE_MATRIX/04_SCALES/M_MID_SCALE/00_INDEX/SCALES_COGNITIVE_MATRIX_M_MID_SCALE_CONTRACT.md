# SCALES COGNITIVE MATRIX M MID SCALE CONTRACT

## 0. Status
Cognitive Matrix-plane contract for **COGNITIVE MATRIX M MID SCALE CONTRACT**. AMOS_MODEL; canonical status CONDITIONAL; implementation PARTIAL.

## 1. Scope
Governs primitives L00–L29, lifecycle operations O00–O16, control planes C01–C09, scales, cell registry, routing, validation, generators as they bear on `COGNITIVE MATRIX M MID SCALE CONTRACT`. Bounded by dependency closure: conclusions inherit the weakest load-bearing premise.

## 2. Contract terms
- **Typed artifacts** — every artifact declares artifact_type, epistemic class, scope, regime.
- **Firewalls preserved** — CAPABILITY ≠ AUTHORITY · PROPOSAL ≠ COMMIT · OBSERVED ≠ CURRENT · TEST_PASS ≠ TRUTH.
- **Epochs distinct** — state_version ≠ causal_epoch ≠ policy_epoch ≠ provenance_epoch unless an explicit mapping licenses equivalence.
- **Local finality requires proof** — demonstrated dependency closure may avoid coordination; assumed independence may not.
- **Selective invalidation** — failure invalidates dependent descendants only; unrelated state is preserved.

## 3. Invariants
- Fail closed on UNKNOWN/GAP; gaps stay visible, never promoted to PASS.
- Confidence of any conclusion ≤ confidence of its weakest load-bearing premise (ceiling 0.95).
- Consequential effects emit receipts; rollback basin exists before mutation.
- Competing hypotheses remain visible when evidence does not discriminate.

## 4. Executed reference
No subsystem-local executor yet. Existing executed validators for the OS: routing-policy validator 19/19 ([[ROUTING_POLICY_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]]) and authz invariant engine 17/17 ([[AUTHZ_ENGINE_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]]) — cited as pattern, not as evidence for this artifact.

## 5. Gaps
Runtime enforcement, persistence binding, and empirical validation remain OPEN (UNKNOWN/GAP). Promotion beyond AMOS_MODEL requires the promotion-gate checklist plus an executed receipt specific to this contract.

## 6. Falsifiers
F1: canonical source defines different semantics for this surface. F2: an executed test contradicts a declared invariant. F3: this contract silently collapses a protected firewall.
## Worked semantics
Given an operation touching `SCALES · COGNITIVE MATRIX M MID SCALE CONTRACT` within the Cognitive Matrix plane:
1. **Admit** — resolve the artifact by id + version; unresolved id ⇒ `UNKNOWN/GAP`, fail closed.
2. **Bind scope** — declare domain / regime / H-M-L applicability before any mutation.
3. **Check authority** — authority_ref must be epoch-valid; capability alone never authorizes.
4. **Validate preconditions** — dependency closure traversed to the smallest result-changing set.
5. **Propose** — candidate state is non-authoritative until gates pass (`PROPOSAL ≠ COMMIT`).
6. **Commit or hold** — on any failed premise: preserve unaffected state, invalidate dependent descendants only, record receipt.

## Promotion-gate checklist
- [ ] typed schema bound to this artifact
- [ ] identity + versioning implemented
- [ ] negative cases covered (missing · malformed · stale · unauthorized input)
- [ ] provenance edges persisted and validated
- [ ] rollback basin demonstrated for consequential effects
- [ ] executed validation receipt specific to this artifact
- [ ] unresolved critical gaps registered as UNKNOWN/GAP (visible)
