# 09_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH — Dependency Graph Contract Overview

**Package:** `09_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH`
**Class:** `COGNITIVE_MATRIX_INFRASTRUCTURE_CONTRACT`
**Epistemic class:** `DERIVED / MODEL EXTENSION`
**Status:** `CONTRACT_FILLED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED / NOT_VALIDATED`
**Filled by:** governed generator `12_GENERATORS/fill_infra_readmes.py` · **Date:** `2026-08-26`

## Scope

The Dependency Graph captures directed edges between Matrix surfaces so that invalidation propagates locally (descendants only) instead of globally. Edge presence is a structural claim; edge correctness requires validation evidence.

## Hard boundaries

```text
EDGE_DECLARED != EDGE_VALIDATED
Cycles in the dependency graph are defects
Invalidation follows descendants only; unrelated state is preserved
```

## Dependency position

- 01–04 package dependencies feed edges
- 10 routing and 11 validation consume invalidation semantics

## RSCF completion state

```yaml
claim_class: DERIVED
evidence: []            # no measured evidence at this layer

```

## Gap matrix

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Definition/contract | FILLED (this pass) |
| Executable implementation | UNKNOWN/GAP |
| Validation evidence | UNKNOWN/GAP |
| Authority binding | UNKNOWN/GAP |
| Runtime integration | UNKNOWN/GAP |

```text
CONTRACT_FILLED != IMPLEMENTED
DOCUMENTED != EXECUTABLE
MODEL != VERIFIED
UNKNOWN/GAP != PASS
```
