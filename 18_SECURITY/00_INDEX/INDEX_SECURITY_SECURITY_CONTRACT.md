# INDEX SECURITY SECURITY CONTRACT

## Index
- See also — [[INDEX_SECURITY_README]]
- See also — [[SECURITY_MAP]]

## Indexing rule
This index resolves by basename within its own directory. Cross-plane resolution goes through [[00_HOME]] and [[AMOS_RSCF_NODES]].

## Gaps
Automated link-integrity execution for this index is PARTIAL ([[ROUTING_POLICY_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]] · [[AUTHZ_ENGINE_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]]).
## Worked semantics
Given an operation touching `SECURITY · SECURITY CONTRACT` within the Security plane:
1. **Admit** — resolve the artifact by id + version; unresolved id ⇒ `UNKNOWN/GAP`, fail closed.
2. **Bind scope** — declare domain / regime / H-M-L applicability before any mutation.
3. **Check authority** — authority_ref must be epoch-valid; capability alone never authorizes.
4. **Validate preconditions** — dependency closure traversed to the smallest result-changing set.
5. **Propose** — candidate state is non-authoritative until gates pass (`PROPOSAL ≠ COMMIT`).
6. **Commit or hold** — on any failed premise: preserve unaffected state, invalidate dependent descendants only, record receipt.

## Promotion-gate checklist
- [ ] typed schema bound to this artifact
- [ ] identity + versioning implemented
- [ ] negative cases covered (missing · malformed · stale · unauthorized input)
- [ ] provenance edges persisted and validated
- [ ] rollback basin demonstrated for consequential effects
- [ ] executed validation receipt specific to this artifact
- [ ] unresolved critical gaps registered as UNKNOWN/GAP (visible)

## Cross-plane bindings
- Governed by canon — LAW_HIERARCHY|AMOS Core Laws · [[LAW_HIERARCHY]]
- Kernel interaction — [[KERNEL_README]]
- Control-plane gates — [[CONTROL_PLANE_README]]
- Observed by — [[OBSERVABILITY_README]] · never treated as authority
- Recovered via operations — [[OPERATIONS_README]]
