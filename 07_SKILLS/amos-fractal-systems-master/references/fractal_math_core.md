# AMOS Math Core — Fractal Mathematics & Cognitive Architecture Runtime

## Overview

**AMOS Math Core** provides the mathematical and computational foundation for fractal, persistence, heavy-tail, multifractal, signal-processing, and information-analysis components used by the wider AMOS architecture.

The module combines established mathematical/statistical methods with AMOS architecture adapters while preserving an important boundary:

> Mathematical estimators measure properties of supplied data. They do not establish that every AMOS system, cognitive process, or real-world phenomenon is intrinsically fractal.

The runtime includes:

* fractal-dimension estimation;
* Hurst and persistence analysis;
* detrended fluctuation analysis;
* fractional and heavy-tail noise generation;
* continuous wavelet analysis;
* spectral cycle detection;
* multifractal-spectrum estimation;
* tail-index estimation;
* entropy-rate approximation;
* mutual information;
* comprehensive fractal-analysis pipelines;
* AMOS data/configuration loaders;
* hierarchical architecture generation;
* Fractal Cognitive Architecture v2 integration; and
* Fractal Cognitive Programming integration.

# 1. Mathematical Runtime Model

The central decomposition is:

[
x_{t+1}=F(x_t)+\varepsilon_t
]

where:

* (x_t) is the observed or modeled state at time (t);
* (F) is the deterministic or estimated structural component;
* (\varepsilon_t) is the residual/noise component.

Depending on the dataset, additional estimated quantities may include:

[
D = \text{fractal dimension}
]

[
H = \text{Hurst exponent}
]

[
\alpha = \text{tail or scaling exponent}
]

These quantities are **estimated from data**. They are not universal constants of the AMOS architecture.

# 2. Epistemic Boundary

AMOS Math Core separates four different kinds of mathematical use.

### Established Mathematics

Examples include:

* box-counting dimension;
* Grassberger–Procaccia correlation dimension;
* information dimension;
* R/S analysis;
* detrended fluctuation analysis;
* Pareto distributions;
* Fourier/spectral analysis;
* wavelet analysis;
* mutual information; and
* multifractal partition functions.

### Numerical Estimation

Finite datasets require numerical approximations of theoretical limits.

For example,

[
D_B =
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0}
\frac{\log N(\epsilon)}
{\log(1/\epsilon)}
]

cannot normally be evaluated as a literal limit from finite observations.

The implementation therefore estimates the slope over a selected scaling region.

### Implementation Approximation

Some routines use practical numerical approximations rather than exact reference algorithms.

The mathematical object and its software approximation should therefore remain distinguishable.

### AMOS MODEL Integration

When mathematical quantities are mapped onto cognitive architecture, architecture entropy, recursive H/M/L organization, or other AMOS structures, that mapping remains an **AMOS MODEL** unless independently validate
