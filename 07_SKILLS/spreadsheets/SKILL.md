# Spreadsheets

## Identity

Origin architect: **Trang Phan**. Domain: c10. Parent: amos-c10-tech-engineering-master. Epistemic class: SOURCE_CLAIM. H/M/L: M.

## When to Use

- When analyzing software architecture: patterns, dependencies, coupling
- When discovering program behavior via black-box analysis or symbolic execution
- When verifying code facts: type safety, memory safety, termination
- When enforcing bounded code: resource, time, and capability limits
- When the parent skill (`amos-c10-tech-engineering-master`) routes to this specialized capability
- When managing lifecycle operations across classify, validate, trace, assess, and detect
- When detecting drift in evidence chains, provenance freshness, or confidence calibration
- When validating outputs against domain constraints and epistemic class

## Capabilities

- **spreadsheets.parse_workbook**: Parse spreadsheet files (.xlsx/.csv): extract sheets, cells, formulas, and named ranges
- **spreadsheets.validate_structure**: Validate workbook structure: cell references, formula syntax, and data type consistency
- **spreadsheets.extract_data**: Extract structured data: tables, pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting
- **spreadsheets.generate_workbook**: Generate spreadsheets from structured data with formulas, formatting, and charts
- **spreadsheets.track_provenance**: Track provenance of cell data to source sheets and transformation formulas
- **spreadsheets.manage_lifecycle**: Manage lifecycle: classify, validate, trace, assess, detect.
- **spreadsheets.detect_drift**: Detect drift in evidence chains, provenance freshness, or confidence calibration.
- **spreadsheets.validate_outputs**: Validate outputs against domain constraints and epistemic class.

### Utility Tool Integration

This utility skill operates as a file-format handling tool within the AMOS framework. It follows the AMOS tool integration laws:

**Tool laws**:

- `TOOL != CAPABILITY`: a tool is a deployment artifact; a capability is an ontological declaration
- `FORMAT != CONTENT`: file format is not content; content must be extracted and validated
- `PROCESSING != UNDERSTANDING`: processing a file does not mean understanding its content

**Integration protocol**:

1. **Receive**: receive the file with provenance
1. **Parse**: parse the file format
1. **Extract**: extract content with epistemic labels
1. **Validate**: validate extracted content against schema
1. **Output**: output structured content with provenance

### Epistemic Boundary

This utility skill is an operational tool. It does not prove content correctness, that all format variations are supported, or that parsing is always accurate.

## Failure Modes

- **Insufficient evidence**: If source material is insufficient, mark as UNKNOWN/GAP and fail closed — do not fabricate.
- **Scope violation**: If the query falls outside the skill's declared scope, escalate to the parent skill or steward.
- **Binding broken**: If 1:1:1 binding (skill→agent→workflow) is broken, flag routing mismatch and block execution.
- **Validation failure**: If validation gates fail, downgrade confidence, flag the gap, and escalate — do not force-fit.
- **Epistemic overreach**: If a claim exceeds the established evidence or epistemic class, retract and relabel.

## Validation Gates

- **G1 (Law of Law)**: No unresolved contradictions within the skill's scope.
- **G2 (Epistemic class)**: All claims labeled SOURCE / DERIVED / AMOS_MODEL / EMPIRICAL — never claim beyond evidence.
- **G3 (Provenance)**: Source path recorded for every derived claim.
- **G4 (Anti-overreach)**: No claim beyond the skill's declared scope and epistemic class.
- **G5 (Equation firewall)**: Equations carry status tags (ESTABLISHED_MATH / SOURCE_DERIVED / AMOS_MODEL / EMPIRICALLY_CALIBRATED / UNVERIFIED).
- **G6 (Failure mode)**: On validation failure, downgrade confidence, flag the gap, escalate — do not force-fit.

## Examples

- **Scenario**: When analyzing software architecture: patterns, dependencies, coupling

  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (c10)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance

- **Scenario**: When discovering program behavior via black-box analysis or symbolic execution

  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (c10)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance

- **Scenario**: When verifying code facts: type safety, memory safety, termination

  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (c10)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not use** for tasks outside the c10 domain
- **Do not use** when the query requires empirical validation that this skill cannot provide
- **Do not use** when a parent skill or higher-level orchestrator should route instead
- **Do not bypass** epistemic class labeling — every output must carry SOURCE/DERIVED/AMOS_MODEL tags
- **Do not chain** more than 3 skills without explicit orchestrator approval

## Composition

- **Parent**: `amos-c10-tech-engineering-master` — routes to this skill when c10 specialization is needed
- **Peers**: Other skills in the `c10` domain may be composed in sequence
- **Orchestrator**: The parent skill or `AMOS_HOME` orchestrates routing
- **Workflow**: Each skill has a corresponding workflow in `26_WORKFLOWS/`
- **Agent**: Each skill has a corresponding agent in `06_AGENTS/`

## Evaluation

### Success Criteria

- Output includes epistemic class label (SOURCE/DERIVED/AMOS_MODEL/EMPIRICAL)
- Output includes provenance reference to source evidence
- Output includes confidence ceiling (capped at 0.95 for DERIVED, 1.0 for SOURCE_CANON)
- Output includes gap flags for unresolved unknowns
- Output does not exceed declared scope

### Failure Modes

- **Overreach**: Output claims validity beyond its epistemic class
- **Scope creep**: Output addresses questions outside the declared domain
- **Provenance loss**: Output cannot trace back to source evidence
- **Confidence inflation**: Output confidence exceeds the weakest-premise ceiling

## Error Handling

- **On scope violation**: Reject the query and route back to parent skill
- **On missing evidence**: Flag as GAP and reduce confidence ceiling to 0.5
- **On contradiction**: Flag as CRITICAL_GAP and halt until resolved
- **On provenance loss**: Mark output as UNKNOWN and require human review
- **On drift**: Trigger drift alignment via `amos-ai-drift-alignment-governor`

## Do not use

- For generic engineering analysis outside the tech/engineering framework
- To claim empirical validation of software engineering laws
- As a substitute for domain-specific technical or engineering evidence
- Outside tech/engineering domain reasoning
