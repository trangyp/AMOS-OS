# Target Of Repair Intelligence

## Identity

Origin architect: **Trang Phan**. Domain: audit. Parent: amos-audit-repair-master. Epistemic class: SOURCE_CLAIM. H/M/L: M.
## When to Use

- When auditing claims against evidence and provenance
- When detecting gaps in capabilities, evidence, tests, or monitors
- When allocating repair resources to highest-leverage gaps
- When verifying gap closure across the full lifecycle chain
- When the parent skill (`amos-audit-repair-master`) routes to this specialized capability
- When managing lifecycle operations across classify, validate, trace, assess, and detect
- When detecting drift in evidence chains, provenance freshness, or confidence calibration
- When validating outputs against domain constraints and epistemic class

## Capabilities

- **target_of.audit_claim**: Audit claims against evidence, provenance, and epistemic class
- **target_of.detect_gap**: Detect gaps: missing capabilities, missing evidence, missing tests, missing monitors
- **target_of.allocate_repair**: Allocate repair resources to highest-leverage gaps and failure modes
- **target_of.verify_closure**: Verify gap closure: requirement → capability → component → test → evidence
- **target_of.benchmark_forensics**: Benchmark forensic analysis: trace performance regressions to root causes

> **Reference**: See `references/vault_domain_knowledge.md` (content_hash: e390ceb1dc8f0a41) for the full vault-sourced domain knowledge (9031 chars).
- **target_of.manage_lifecycle**: Manage lifecycle: classify, validate, trace, assess, detect.
- **target_of.detect_drift**: Detect drift in evidence chains, provenance freshness, or confidence calibration.
- **target_of.validate_outputs**: Validate outputs against domain constraints and epistemic class.

### Target-of-Repair Intelligence

The Cognitive Organism OS defines target-of-repair intelligence for identifying what needs to be repaired and why.

**Target identification**:
1. **Detect failure**: identify the failure symptom
2. **Trace cause**: trace the failure to its root cause
3. **Identify target**: identify the specific component that needs repair
4. **Classify repair**: classify the repair type (patch, replace, refactor, rebuild)
5. **Estimate impact**: estimate the impact of the repair on the system

**Target types**:
- **Capability target**: a capability that is not functioning correctly
- **Binding target**: a 1:1:1 binding that is broken
- **Provenance target**: a provenance chain that is broken
- **Consistency target**: a contradiction that needs resolution
- **Drift target**: a component that has drifted from its declaration

**Law**: `SYMPTOM != CAUSE`. Repairing the symptom does not repair the cause. Target-of-repair intelligence traces symptoms to causes.

### Epistemic Boundary

Target-of-repair intelligence is a diagnostic construct. It does not prove all failures are traceable, that root causes are always identifiable, or that repair always fixes the issue.

## Failure Modes

- **Insufficient evidence**: If source material is insufficient, mark as UNKNOWN/GAP and fail closed — do not fabricate.
- **Scope violation**: If the query falls outside the skill's declared scope, escalate to the parent skill or steward.
- **Binding broken**: If 1:1:1 binding (skill→agent→workflow) is broken, flag routing mismatch and block execution.
- **Validation failure**: If validation gates fail, downgrade confidence, flag the gap, and escalate — do not force-fit.
- **Epistemic overreach**: If a claim exceeds the established evidence or epistemic class, retract and relabel.

## Validation Gates

- **G1 (Law of Law)**: No unresolved contradictions within the skill's scope.
- **G2 (Epistemic class)**: All claims labeled SOURCE / DERIVED / AMOS_MODEL / EMPIRICAL — never claim beyond evidence.
- **G3 (Provenance)**: Source path recorded for every derived claim.
- **G4 (Anti-overreach)**: No claim beyond the skill's declared scope and epistemic class.
- **G5 (Equation firewall)**: Equations carry status tags (ESTABLISHED_MATH / SOURCE_DERIVED / AMOS_MODEL / EMPIRICALLY_CALIBRATED / UNVERIFIED).
- **G6 (Failure mode)**: On validation failure, downgrade confidence, flag the gap, escalate — do not force-fit.

## Examples

- **Scenario**: When auditing claims against evidence and provenance
  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (audit)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance

- **Scenario**: When detecting gaps in capabilities, evidence, tests, or monitors
  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (audit)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance

- **Scenario**: When allocating repair resources to highest-leverage gaps
  - **Input**: A query matching this skill's domain (audit)
  - **Output**: Structured result with epistemic labels and provenance


## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not use** for tasks outside the audit domain
- **Do not use** when the query requires empirical validation that this skill cannot provide
- **Do not use** when a parent skill or higher-level orchestrator should route instead
- **Do not bypass** epistemic class labeling — every output must carry SOURCE/DERIVED/AMOS_MODEL tags
- **Do not chain** more than 3 skills without explicit orchestrator approval


## Composition

- **Parent**: `amos-audit-repair-master` — routes to this skill when audit specialization is needed
- **Peers**: Other skills in the `audit` domain may be composed in sequence
- **Orchestrator**: The parent skill or `AMOS_HOME` orchestrates routing
- **Workflow**: Each skill has a corresponding workflow in `08_WORKFLOWS/`
- **Agent**: Each skill has a corresponding agent in `06_AGENTS/`


## Evaluation

### Success Criteria

- Output includes epistemic class label (SOURCE/DERIVED/AMOS_MODEL/EMPIRICAL)
- Output includes provenance reference to source evidence
- Output includes confidence ceiling (capped at 0.95 for DERIVED, 1.0 for SOURCE_CANON)
- Output includes gap flags for unresolved unknowns
- Output does not exceed declared scope

### Failure Modes

- **Overreach**: Output claims validity beyond its epistemic class
- **Scope creep**: Output addresses questions outside the declared domain
- **Provenance loss**: Output cannot trace back to source evidence
- **Confidence inflation**: Output confidence exceeds the weakest-premise ceiling


## Error Handling

- **On scope violation**: Reject the query and route back to parent skill
- **On missing evidence**: Flag as GAP and reduce confidence ceiling to 0.5
- **On contradiction**: Flag as CRITICAL_GAP and halt until resolved
- **On provenance loss**: Mark output as UNKNOWN and require human review
- **On drift**: Trigger drift alignment via `amos-ai-drift-alignment-governor`


## Do not use

- For generic audit analysis outside the AMOS audit/repair framework
- To claim empirical validation of repair or recovery theories
- As a substitute for domain-specific audit or quality evidence
- Outside audit/repair domain reasoning
