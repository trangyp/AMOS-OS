# COMMIT CONTROL PLANE OBSERVABILITY

## 0. Status
Control Plane-plane artifact. AMOS_MODEL · CONDITIONAL · implementation PARTIAL.

## 1. Purpose
`COMMIT · CONTROL PLANE OBSERVABILITY` defines typed artifact specification, serving the Control Plane plane's obligation: governance surfaces that gate effects: task contracts, capability, policy, authority, provenance, semantic transactions, observability, effects, commit, exposure, replay, rollback.

## 2. Semantics
- Every load-bearing field is typed; unknown values are recorded as `UNKNOWN/GAP`, never invented.
- Scope and regime are declared on every claim; cross-regime transfer requires an explicit bridge.
- Confidence ceiling 0.95; conclusion confidence ≤ weakest load-bearing premise.

## 3. Failure modes guarded
STALE_READ · SCOPE_LEAK · REGIME_DRIFT · CONFIDENCE_INFLATION · AUTHORITY_ESCALATION · PROVENANCE_LOSS · SILENT_PARTIAL_COMMIT · UNKNOWN_AS_VALID.

## 4. Validation
No artifact-specific executor yet; executed OS validators exist as pattern ([[25_COGNITIVE_MATRIX/11_VALIDATION/ROUTING_POLICY_VALIDATION_RECEIPT|ROUTING_POLICY_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]] · [[03_CONTROL_PLANE/04_AUTHORITY/AUTHZ_ENGINE_VALIDATION_RECEIPT|AUTHZ_ENGINE_VALIDATION_RECEIPT]]). Required tests before promotion: identity, type-contract, negative-case (missing/malformed/stale input), authority boundary, rollback.

## 5. Gaps
Implementation binding, empirical validation, and cross-artifact consistency checks remain OPEN (UNKNOWN/GAP).

## 6. Falsifiers
F1: canonical source contradicts declared semantics. F2: executed test violates a stated invariant. F3: artifact promotes UNKNOWN to PASS.
## Worked semantics
Given an operation touching `COMMIT · CONTROL PLANE OBSERVABILITY` within the Control Plane plane:
1. **Admit** — resolve the artifact by id + version; unresolved id ⇒ `UNKNOWN/GAP`, fail closed.
2. **Bind scope** — declare domain / regime / H-M-L applicability before any mutation.
3. **Check authority** — authority_ref must be epoch-valid; capability alone never authorizes.
4. **Validate preconditions** — dependency closure traversed to the smallest result-changing set.
5. **Propose** — candidate state is non-authoritative until gates pass (`PROPOSAL ≠ COMMIT`).
6. **Commit or hold** — on any failed premise: preserve unaffected state, invalidate dependent descendants only, record receipt.

## Promotion-gate checklist
- [ ] typed schema bound to this artifact
- [ ] identity + versioning implemented
- [ ] negative cases covered (missing · malformed · stale · unauthorized input)
- [ ] provenance edges persisted and validated
- [ ] rollback basin demonstrated for consequential effects
- [ ] executed validation receipt specific to this artifact
- [ ] unresolved critical gaps registered as UNKNOWN/GAP (visible)
