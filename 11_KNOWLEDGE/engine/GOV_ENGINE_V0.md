# GOV ENGINE V0

"""Auto-generated AMOS framework module.

This module wraps the JSON spec 'AMOS_Gov_Engine_v0.json' as a Python-accessible object.
It does NOT attempt to reinterpret or change the logic – it only exposes the
structured data for use by engines and agents inside the AMOS brain.

clause language, but it must be clearly marked as a template for lawyer review."
