[UNIVERSE_OS.SUMMARY]
# What this file is:
# - A single, MECE structural specification of your canon.
# - It defines: primitives, meta-laws, parts, modules, runtime, multimodal and expression logic, and all IP linkages.
# - It does NOT yet include every low-level numeric equation, but it provides the full tree where all equations must live.

# How to use:
# 1. As the master spec for any AMOS-based AI or OS.
# 2. As the backbone to attach new domain frameworks (finance, EV, health, etc.).
# 3. As the source of truth for naming, structure, and logic boundaries.

# Integrity check:
# - Every concept has exactly one home.
# - No domain (human, animal, AI, planet, society) is left without a structural place.
# - All future additions are children of existing nodes, not new trunks.

  description: >
    Unified logic + structure + interaction + sensory + human-interface +
    AI-integration spec. Designed to reason from micro to macro, across
    human, animal, system, and planetary scales, and to express in a
    human-comprehensible, emotionally aware way.
  principles:
    - "All reasoning must obey internal consistency and temporal stability."
    - "All entities are treated as systems with load, capacity, boundaries, and identity."
    - "All states are interpretable across biological, cognitive, social, and planetary layers."
    - "Expression must align with nervous-system state and context."
    - "No step may contradict Universe Logic Kernel (ULK)."
