# SOTA Agent Skill / Workflow / Orchestration Repositories

**Epistemic class:** `DERIVED`  
**Raw source:** [[SOTA_AGENT_SKILL_WORKFLOW_REPOS_2026_08_25]]

## Top pick for skill security / registry hardening

`tech-leads-club/agent-skills` (5.1k★)  
- Designed for safe, validated skill distribution.
- Aligns directly with AMOS guardrail and provenance concerns: lockfiles, content hashing, Snyk scanning, path/symlink guards, audit trails.
- Best candidate for importing skill-lifecycle controls.

## Top pick for production multi-agent orchestration

`microsoft/agent-framework` (13.1k★)  
- Multi-language, production-grade agent and workflow framework.
- Supports durable, observable, graph-based multi-agent patterns: sequential, concurrent, handoff, group collaboration.
- Best candidate for hardening AMOS `amos-workflow-runner` and runtime orchestration.

## Top pick for repository-native agentic CI/CD

`github/gh-aw` — GitHub Agentic Workflows  
- Markdown-defined workflows compiled to GitHub Actions.
- Sandboxed, scoped permissions, `safe-outputs`, threat detection, cost controls.
- Best candidate for publishing AMOS workflows into a CI/CD execution layer.

## Specialized candidates

| Repo | Strength | AMOS fit |
|------|----------|----------|
| `yuzhaopeng-up/skill-framework` | 208-skill inventory, L0–L4 classification, YAML templates | Skill taxonomy and governance checklists |
| `agent-skill-harbor` | Org-wide catalog, recommended/discouraged/prohibited governance | Enterprise skill discovery and provenance |
| `gfernandf/agent-skill-registry` | Declarative capabilities/skills, machine-readable catalogs | Standardized capability vocabulary |
| `yiheng8023/agent-skills-curated` | Reviewed, provenance-tracked, release manifests | Curated third-party skill ingestion |
| `microsoft/conductor` | Deterministic YAML workflows, Jinja2 routing, parallel execution | Multi-agent workflow definition language |
| `agentenv/agentflow` | Large-scale agent graphs, optimization rounds, multi-target execution | Scale-out workflow harnesses |

## Synthesis for AMOS

The strongest near-term integration path is:

1. Adopt `tech-leads-club/agent-skills` guardrail patterns for the `skill_guardrail_checker` pipeline.
2. Study `microsoft/agent-framework` orchestration primitives to enhance `amos-workflow-runner` and `amos-agent-orchestrator`.
3. Mirror `github/gh-aw` for execution-boundary controls and cost governance.

**Confidence ceiling:** 0.85 (derived from README claims and star counts, not empirical benchmarks).
