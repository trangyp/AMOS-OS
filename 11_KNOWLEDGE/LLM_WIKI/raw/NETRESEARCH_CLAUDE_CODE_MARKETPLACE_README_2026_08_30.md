## What are Agentic Skills?

**Agentic Skills** are portable packages of procedural knowledge that work across any AI coding agent supporting the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

Every listed repository is also an [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org) package: a `plugin.json` at the repository root plus the `skills/` directory, which conformant clients load directly from the source repository. This marketplace stays the Claude Code install path — Agent Plugins standardizes packaging, not distribution.

**Supported Platforms:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot
- OpenAI Codex
- Gemini CLI
- Amp, Goose, Roo Code, OpenCode, and [30+ more](https://agentskills.io)

## Installation

### Claude Code (Marketplace)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add netresearch/claude-code-marketplace
```

Then use `/plugin` to browse and install individual skills.

### npx (Any Agent)

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/netresearch/{repo-name} --skill {skill-name}
```

Browse all skills at [skills.sh/netresearch](https://skills.sh/netresearch).

## Available Skills

### Skill-skills

A small family of skills whose subject matter is other skills. At the center runs a loop — Harness, Assessment, Retro — and around it sit authoring tools that feed the loop.

## Architecture

This marketplace uses **source references** — it contains only a `marketplace.json` catalog that points to individual skill repositories. Claude Code fetches skills directly from their source repos when installed.

The GitHub Pages site is built from [`site/`](site/README.md); the design decisions behind it are recorded as [ADRs in `docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md).

## Adding a Skill

Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "description": "What it does and when to use it",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "netresearch/my-skill-repo"
  },
  "category": "development"
}
```

## Internal Marketplace

Netresearch also maintains an internal marketplace for proprietary skills:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add git@git.netresearch.de:coding-ai/marketplace.git
```
