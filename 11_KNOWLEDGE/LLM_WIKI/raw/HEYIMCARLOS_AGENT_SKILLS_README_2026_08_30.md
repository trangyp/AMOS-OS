# Hey I m Carlos Agent Skills README — Raw Capture

Source: `https://github.com/heyimcarlos/agent-skills`

## agent skills

Skills and subagents for AI coding agents — one source of truth, installed natively in Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, and 50+ other agent CLIs through [`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

Skills encode the workflows a senior engineer follows: research before coding, spec before plan, plan before implement, verify before ship. Packaged so the same workflows trigger across every tool you drive.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx skills@latest add heyimcarlos/agent-skills
```

Pick which skills to install and which agents to install them into. The CLI auto-detects supported agent CLIs on your machine and writes `SKILL.md` files into each one's native skill path.

### Claude Code (full plugin)

`npx skills add` installs skills only. To also pick up the research subagents in `agents/`, install via Claude Code's plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add heyimcarlos/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@agent-skills
```

## Layout

```
skills/
  engineering/    # daily code work — git, PRs, planning, implementation, debug
  qrspi/          # the QRSPI workflow as prefixed qrspi-* setup, create, and iterate skills
  misc/           # cross-cutting productivity and writing skills
agents/           # Claude Code subagents (codebase + thoughts + web research)
.claude-plugin/
  plugin.json     # single-plugin manifest read by `npx skills` and Claude Code
```

## QRSPI workflow

Each stage is its own skill, with an `iterate-*` sibling for surgical adjustments without restarting the workflow.

| Stage     | Skill                                                                                                                                                                                   | Purpose                                                               |

QRSPI skills use a `qrspi-` name prefix so they are easy to find and select during installation. They set `disable-model-invocation: true` — the human invokes each phase deliberately rather than letting the model auto-trigger them.

Every doc-producing QRSPI skill (all of the above except `qrspi-create-worktree`) accepts an optional `--output=html` flag. When present, the skill emits a reveal.js slide deck alongside the canonical markdown — color, SVG diagrams, annotated code, comparison tables. Iterate skills detect the sibling `.html` and refresh both. See [`skills/qrspi/HTML-OUTPUT.md`](./skills/qrspi/HTML-OUTPUT.md) for the conventions and per-phase slide structures.

## Complete skill inventory

This inventory compares the repository with the shared global skill directory at `~/.agents/skills`, Codex's built-in system skills, and the plugin-managed skills available in Codex. It was last checked on 2026-08-24.

### Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add heyimcarlos/agent-skills
```

All shared global skills with external lineage differed from their current upstream packages and now ship here as Codex-maintained forks. The [upstream audit](./UPSTREAMS.md) records the comparison commits, per-skill results, and required license notices.

### Skills maintained here

These skills ship from this repository. "Global" means the skill was also present in `~/.agents/skills` when this inventory was taken.

### Codex-managed skills

These skills were available through Codex's built-in skill set or globally managed plugins when this inventory was taken. Codex or the named plugin owns the files and updates them as a unit.

### Subagents (Claude Code only)

Specialist research personas in [`agents/`](./agents/), invoked from skills via the `Agent` tool. Only installed by the Claude Code plugin path; `npx skills` doesn't install subagents into other CLIs (they don't have the concept).

- [**codebase-locator**](./agents/codebase-locator.md) — super grep/glob; locates files, directories, and components by description.
- [**codebase-analyzer**](./agents/codebase-analyzer.md) — deep dive on implementation details for specific components.
- [**codebase-pattern-finder**](./agents/codebase-pattern-finder.md) — finds similar implementations and concrete code examples.
- [**thoughts-locator**](./agents/thoughts-locator.md) — discovers relevant documents in the `thoughts/` metadata directory.
- [**thoughts-analyzer**](./agents/thoughts-analyzer.md) — research equivalent of codebase-analyzer for `thoughts/`.
- [**web-search-researcher**](./agents/web-search-researcher.md) — modern, web-only information.

## Editing

Canonical content lives in `skills/<bucket>/<name>/SKILL.md` and `agents/<name>.md`. After adding or removing a skill, update [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](./.claude-plugin/plugin.json) and the reference section above.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) (alias `CLAUDE.md`) for repo conventions, skill anatomy, and orchestration rules.
