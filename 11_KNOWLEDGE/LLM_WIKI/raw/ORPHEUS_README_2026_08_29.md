You:     "Build me a content pipeline that researches topics, writes articles,
          reviews for accuracy, and publishes to my blog"

ORPHEUS:  ✓ Analyzed → 4 experts, 5 workers, 4-stage sequential pipeline
          ✓ Generated → orchestrator, contracts, registry, scripts
          ✓ Validated → DAG clean, contracts compatible
          ✓ Ready in 30 seconds. Run it whenever you want.
```

## The Problem

You want to automate a multi-step workflow with AI. So you reach for a multi-agent framework. Now you need:

- N separate LLM instances, each with its own context
- Inter-agent communication (HTTP, gRPC, message queues)
- State management (databases, checkpoints)
- Deployment infrastructure (Docker, services, orchestrators)
- Python/TypeScript glue code to wire it all together
- Monitoring and observability tools

All this to coordinate a few LLM calls.

## The ORPHEUS Approach

**What if most "agents" are just a prompt + a tool list + a routing rule?**

Your coding agent already has LLM reasoning, tool access, web search, code execution, file I/O, and subagent spawning. ORPHEUS structures these existing capabilities into composable **skills** — no new infrastructure required.

| | Multi-Agent | ORPHEUS |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Runtime | N LLM instances | 1 coding agent |
| Communication | HTTP/gRPC/queues | Filesystem |
| Deployment | N services | 1 folder |
| Configuration | Python/YAML code | Natural language |
| New capability | Deploy a service | Write a markdown file |
| Observability | External tools | Built-in decision logs |
| Dependencies | pip/npm/docker | **None** |

## How It Works

### Describe → Generate → Run → Evolve

The entire lifecycle — create, run, diagnose, validate, modify — through natural language. Same interface, same conversation.

Every generated system follows the same pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    ORCH["🎭 Orchestrator<br/>decomposes & dispatches"]:::orch

    ORCH --> E1["🧠 Expert A<br/>domain specialist"]:::expert
    ORCH --> E2["🧠 Expert B<br/>domain specialist"]:::expert

    E1 --> W1["⚙️ Worker 1"]:::worker
    E1 --> W2["⚙️ Worker 2"]:::worker
    E2 --> W3["⚙️ Worker 3"]:::worker

    classDef expert fill:#0ea5e9,stroke:#0284c7,color:#fff
    classDef worker fill:#22c55e,stroke:#16a34a,color:#fff
```

- **Orchestrator** decomposes requests into jobs, dispatches to experts, aggregates results
- **Experts** own job types, decide strategy, delegate to workers when needed
- **Workers** execute atomic tasks — reusable across any expert
- **Contracts** define typed I/O between skills for safe composition

## The Meta-System

ORPHEUS manages itself using its own patterns — 4 experts sharing 7 reusable workers:

| Expert | What It Does | When You'd Use It |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **🏗️ Builder** | Creates new skill systems from natural language | *"Build me a system that..."* |
| **🩺 Doctor** | Diagnoses failures, traces root cause, applies behavioral fixes | *"Why did the research step fail?"* |
| **🏥 Auditor** | Runs 7 health checks, produces score and recommendations | *"Validate my system"* |
| **🔧 Surgeon** | Structural modifications with cascading effect analysis | *"Add a fact-checker between research and writing"* |

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/ORPHEUS.git
cp -r ORPHEUS/skill/ ~/.claude/skills/orpheus/
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/orpheus/scripts/*
```

That's it. No pip, no npm, no docker. ORPHEUS is now available in every Claude Code session.

## Quick Start

**1. Create a project folder and open Claude Code:**

```bash
mkdir my-first-pipeline && cd my-first-pipeline
```

**2. Build a system:**

```
Build me an ORPHEUS system that takes a URL, scrapes the content,
summarizes the key points, and saves a markdown report.
```

**3. Run it:**

```
Run the pipeline against https://example.com
```

**4. See what happened:**

```
Validate my system
```

Three prompts. Zero code. Working pipeline.

## Usage Patterns

**Project-local** — each system lives in its project directory:
```bash
cd ~/my-project             # has .orpheus/
"Run the pipeline"          # ORPHEUS detects and executes
```

**Collections** — keep multiple systems as siblings:
```
~/projects/
├── pentest-system/.orpheus/        # cd here → pentest
├── content-pipeline/.orpheus/      # cd here → content
└── code-review/.orpheus/           # cd here → review
```

**Standalone** — install as a named skill for global access:
```
"Install this system as a standalone skill"
# Now triggers by name from any directory
```

## What Gets Generated

```
.orpheus/
├── system.yaml                # Configuration (strategy, retries, logging)
├── registry.yaml              # Skill inventory
├── orchestrator/SKILL.md      # Orchestration logic + routing rules
├── experts/{name}/            # Domain specialists
│   ├── SKILL.md               #   protocol, quality gate, logging
│   └── contract.yaml          #   typed I/O schema
├── workers/{name}/            # Atomic task executors
│   ├── SKILL.md               #   task protocol, output format
│   └── contract.yaml          #   typed I/O schema
├── scripts/                   # Self-contained runtime
└── logs/                      # Decision trails + execution history
```

Systems are **fully self-contained** — runtime scripts are bundled in. No dependency on the global ORPHEUS install.

## Decision Transparency

ORPHEUS doesn't just log what happened. It logs **why**.

```yaml
decision:
  question: "Should this job be handled directly or delegated to workers?"
  options_considered:
    - "direct execution"
    - "delegate to 2 parallel workers"
  chosen: "delegate to 2 parallel workers"
  reasoning: "Topic is broad, requiring searches across multiple
    sub-domains. Parallel workers cover more ground in less time."
  confidence: 0.88
```

The Doctor reads these trails to diagnose issues — tracing not just the failure, but the reasoning that caused it.

## Error Chain Preservation

Errors are never flattened. The full chain from root cause to symptom:

```yaml
error:
  level: orchestrator
  message: "Job 'vuln-analysis' failed after 2 retries"
  original_error:
    level: expert
    message: "CVE lookup failed — worker returned empty results"
    original_error:
      level: worker
      message: "WebSearch returned 0 results for 'CVE Apache 2.4.41'"
```

Every level preserves the original. The Doctor — and you — always see the root cause.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|:---------|:----|
| **Skills, not agents** | Most orchestration doesn't need separate LLM instances. Skills are lighter and composable. |
| **Coding agent is the runtime** | Zero infrastructure. No packages, no services, no deployment. |
| **Filesystem as state bus** | Files persist across subagent boundaries. Natural audit trail. |
| **Inline execution** | Runner operates in 3 nesting levels, preserving conversation context. |
| **Self-contained systems** | Generated systems carry their own scripts. Portable and independent. |
| **Error chains** | Full root-cause traceability across all nesting levels. |
| **Decision logging** | Every decision records alternatives and reasoning. Enables the Doctor. |
| **Context packaging** | User constraints forwarded to subagents. No "lost context" problem. |
| **Composition over configuration** | Simple skills compose into complex systems. No DSL to learn. |
