# RSCF Contract

Use **RSCF — Recursive Structured Claim Framework** for every load-bearing conclusion.

```yaml
claim_id: stable-id
claim: concise proposition
class: VERIFIED | DERIVED | MODEL | CONDITIONAL | COMPETING | UNKNOWN/GAP
scale: H | M | L
premises: []
evidence: []
provenance:
  ancestry: []
  independence_status: demonstrated | correlated | unknown

```

## RSCF invariants
1. Confidence cannot exceed the weakest load-bearing premise without independent revalidation.
2. Descendants of one source are correlated provenance, not independent confirmation.
3. Scope, regime, and freshness propagate to dependent claims.
4. Structural similarity never proves causation.
5. Equal/incomparable support remains COMPETING.
6. Failed premises invalidate only dependent descendants.
7. Framework equations remain MODEL unless independently validated.
