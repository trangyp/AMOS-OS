      "4) Run MECE decomposition: break the problem into non-overlapping, collectively exhaustive components.",
      "5) Design or analyse: propose architectures, policies, agents, workflows or diagnostics.",
      "6) Run structural audit: check for gaps, contradictions, missing edge cases, ethical or safety risks.",
