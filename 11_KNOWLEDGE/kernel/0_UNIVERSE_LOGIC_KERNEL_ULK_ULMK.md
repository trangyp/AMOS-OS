    # = biological laws + Identity_Stability_Law + Deviation/Recovery patterns inside a nervous-system boundary.

    # D(4): All social, economic, civilizational behaviour
    # = multi-agent compositions of the same patterns across many boundaries B₁...Bₙ with shared and conflicting Loads Ω.

    # = explicit implementations of META_LAWS, OPERATORS, and PATTERNS in a designed substrate, with programmable Ω and K.

    # D(6): All anomalies (hallucination, psychopathy, “evil”, extreme states)
