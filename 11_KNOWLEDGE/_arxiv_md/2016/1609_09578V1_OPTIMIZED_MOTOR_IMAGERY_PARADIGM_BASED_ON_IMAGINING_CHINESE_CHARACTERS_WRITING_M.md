Abstract—Background: Motor imagery (MI) is a mental 
representation of motor behavior that has been widely used as a 
control method for a brain–computer interface (BCI), allowing 
communication for the physically impaired. The performance of 
MI based BCI mainly depends on the subject’s ability to 
self-modulate EEG signals. Proper training can help naive 
subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, 
training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is 
time-consuming. Methods: To improve the performance of naive 
subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented 
that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity 
effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left or right hand 
were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.  
Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22–25 years, mean 
23.6±1.16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine 
writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine 
hand movements following the sequence of writing strokes in the 
Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective 
and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with 
a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate 
brain activity. Results: Results showed that the writing task 
paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the 
traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire replies 
indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier 
and more comfortable. Conclusions: The proposed new motor 
imagery paradigm could guide subjects to help them modulate 
brain activity effectively. Results showed that there were 
significant improvements using new paradigm, both in 
classification accuracy and usability.

I. INTRODUCTION 
rain-computer interface systems (BCIs) can translate brain 
activities into commands that could be used to control 
external devices [1-3]. BCIs provide a new communication 
channel for people, which is different from communication 
channels that rely on the conventional neuromuscular pathways 
of peripheral nerves and muscles [4]. Many BCIs are based on 
the EEG recorded noninvasively via electrodes placed on the 
scalp. While various different neural activities can be used as 
features in electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCIs, most BCI 
systems rely on motor imagery [5, 6], event-related potential 
[7-10] or visual evoked potentials [11-14]. 
It has been well established that imagination of limb 
movement could result in event-related desynchronization 
(ERD) [5] and event-related synchronization (ERS) [6]. 
Specifically, movement imagery (MI) affects the mu (8-12Hz) 
and beta waves (13-30Hz) in the EEG. Movement imagery 
produces significant ERD over the contralateral central area 
during imagination of right and left hand movement [15]. The 
basic principle of an MI based BCI entails translating ERD 
phenomena into control commands [16, 17]. However, the 
differences are often not sufficient to provide reliable control 
signals in practical applications [18-20]. It has been reported 
that about 20% of MI BCI users do not attain sufficient 
accuracy to control an application [18]. This phenomenon was 
initially called “BCI illiteracy”, although other terms such as 
“BCI inefficiency” [21] have also been used.  
Many researchers have endeavored to develop algorithms to 
improve performance [22, 23]. Channel selection methods have 
been widely used in MI based BCIs to enhance performance by 
removing task irrelevant and redundant channels [24-26]. Some 
advanced machine learning algorithms were set up to improve 
the performance of BCI [27, 28]. These classifiers could yield 
high classification accuracy. In addition, various feature 
extraction methods have been proposed to detect ERD/ERS 
patterns, which could discriminate different mental states 
effectively [29-31]. However, no matter how outstanding the 
algorithms are, BCIs cannot obtain good performance if 
subjects cannot modulate brain activity as required by the BCI 
[16]. 
To help users modulate brain activity proficiently, many 
feedback training methods have been proposed to improve the 
performance of MI-based BCIs. Feedback can help subjects 
master effective strategies to modulate brain activity by 
providing them the information about EEG changes. In [32], 
Neuper et al. compared realistic feedback and abstract feedback

for the same task. Results showed that there was not much 
difference in training performance. Blankertz et al. proposed 
the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI), in which 
feedback was provided by a discrete form [33]. The BBCI 
could exhibit effective performance quickly in untrained 
subjects. Yue et al. (2012) presented an EEG-based real-time 
control paradigm with visual feedback, in which the external 
device was a simulated inverted pendulum [34]. With suitable 
training procedures, subjects would learn to control unstable 
devices through BCI. [35] investigated the effect of static and 
dynamic visual representations of target movements during the 
BCI neurofeedback training. Other work introduced an 
auditory feedback method, and the results showed that the 
auditory feedback was a suitable substitute for the visual 
equivalent [36]. However, it has been reported that feedback 
can have both inhibitory and facilitative effects on EEG control 
[37]. Each normal feedback training session should begin with 
a calibration run without feedback. The calibration data are 
employed to construct the classifier for the next feedback runs. 
Hence, feedback performance largely depends on the initial 
model, and the calibration data may not be sufficiently 
discriminable. If subjects were unfamiliar with the system and 
failed at MI tasks at the initial state, the feedback training 
session could frustrate subjects [38].  
At the beginning of training process, naive subjects may try 
various motor imagery strategies. If the MI based BCI system 
can provide subjects a proper cue that instructs them to do 
motor imagery the right way, it will save training time and 
reduce frustration. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a suitable 
paradigm for subjects, which will help them to perform the MI 
tasks effectively. 
In most paradigms, only visual or auditory cues were used to 
instruct subjects to perform the corresponding classes of MI 
tasks (such as left hand movement, right hand movement or 
foot movement) [34, 39]. But these cues could not instruct 
subjects how to perform the imagination. The type of 
movement imagery can have a major effect on BCI 
performance, for example, [40] found that subjects who relied 
on visual imagination of hand movement performed worse than 
subjects who focused on the kinesthetic aspect of the same task. 
[41] found that subjects could attain better performance by 
imagining familiar actions. 
The strategy of motor imagery in [41] was effective for a 
small group of people who had formal musical training and had 
played and practiced piano regularly. Since different subjects 
were familiar with different actions, the purpose of this paper 
was to find a familiar action that can be accepted by most 
Chinese people. Therefore, we developed a novel paradigm to 
guide subjects to imagine Chinese characters writing 
movements with their right or left hand.  
In this paradigm, a picture of a hand was used as a cue for 
subjects to focus on one of their hands. A Chinese character 
shown on the screen was used to guide subjects regarding what 
kind of motor imagery task they should perform. Subjects 
imagined moving the chosen hand to follow the strokes of the 
shown Chinese character. In other words, the subjects imagined 
that they were writing on the blackboard using the right or left 
hand. This paradigm would give subjects a specific MI task 
instruction: moving from left to right, moving from top to 
bottom, drawing an oblique line or a point, etc. The task of 
writing a Chinese character can make people focus more 
attention on motor imagery. We compared this task to a 
traditional approach in which an arrow cue stimulus was used. 
II. METHOD  
A. Subjects 
 Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 
23.6±1.16) participated in the motor imagery experiment. All 
subjects signed a written consent form prior to this experiment 
and were paid for their participation. The local ethics 
committee approved the consent form and experimental 
procedure before any subjects participated. All subjects were 
right handed with no clinical history of neurological disorders, 
according to self-reports. All subjects’ native language was 
Mandarin Chinese. None of them had experience with any MI 
based BCI before this study. 
 
B. Experimental paradigms 
After being prepared for EEG recording, the subjects were 
seated in a comfortable chair about 80cm from a standard 24 
inch LED monitor (60 Hz refresh rate, 1920×1080 screen 
resolution) in a shielded room. The cues were presented in the 
middle of the screen. During data acquisition, subjects were 
asked to relax and avoid unnecessary movement.  
Two different types of paradigms were utilized and 
compared in this study: (1) the traditional arrow paradigm, (2) 
the writing task paradigm.  
 
Fig. 1.  Timing of a trial of the traditional arrow paradigm. Each trial consisted 
of task and rest periods. Subjects started to execute MI tasks while the arrow 
appeared on the screen. The time segment between seconds 3 and 7 was used 
for feature extraction. 
 
Throughout both paradigms, motor imagery was performed 
without feedback. The subjects were told to focus on motor 
imagery during the experiment. For each subject, two classes of 
motor imagery were performed: left hand and right hand. These 
tasks were pseudo randomly distributed throughout the run. 
Each experimental paradigm included two runs, and each run is 
comprised of 50 single trials. A total of 100 trials of EEG 
measurements were performed (half for each class of MI). 
(1) The traditional arrow paradigm: This paradigm used an 
arrow pointing to the left or right, which has been widely used 
[42, 43]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, at the beginning of a trial 
(t=0s), a fixation cross appeared on the black screen. After two 
seconds (t=2s), an arrow cue was shown that pointed either the

left or the right (corresponding to one of the two classes of MI 
tasks: left hand or right hand). The subjects had 6s to imagine 
the movement of either their left or right hand, as indicated by 
the cue arrow. In this paradigm, each subject was asked to 
imagine a hand movement which they felt was easiest for them, 
and so the exact types of motor imagery were not consistent 
across subjects. A short break followed, during which the 
screen was black. 
(2) The writing task paradigm: Fig. 2 presented the writing 
task paradigm. Unlike the traditional arrow paradigm, a static 
photograph of a Chinese character and a forearm was displayed 
on the black screen. Before the motor imagery (t=0s), a fixation 
cross was shown on the black screen instructing subjects to get 
ready. After two seconds (t=2s), the fixation cross was replaced 
by a picture of the forearm and Chinese character. The picture 
of the forearm was used as a cue to tell subjects which hand 
movement they should imagine. The Chinese character was to 
instruct the subjects what kind of the writing movement they 
should imagine. Each subject had 6s to perform the MI task. 
During this period, the subjects were asked to imagine hand 
movements that followed the strokes of the Chinese character 
on the screen. It was as though the subject was writing the 
character on the blackboard with the right or left hand. A short 
break (2s) followed, during which the screen was black. Each 
Chinese character used in this paper contains 5 strokes.

task and rest periods. Subjects started to execute MI tasks while the character 
and a forearm appeared on the screen. The time segment between seconds 3 and 
7 was used for feature extraction. 
 
C. EEG acquisition  
 
Fig. 3.  The electrode distribution used in this study. All channels were used for 
signal recording and analysis. 
EEG signals were sampled at 250 Hz through the Neuro Scan 
amplifier (high-pass and low-pass filters: 0.1 Hz and 50 Hz, 
with the mains power supply (50Hz) filtered out) using a 
32-channel cap following the 10-20 international system (Fig. 
3). All channels were used for signal recording and analysis, 
which were referenced to electrode A1 located over the right 
mastoid with a forehead ground (GND). All impedances were 
below 5 k ohms. The sequence of the two paradigms in this 
experiment was counterbalanced. 
 
D. Feature extraction procedure 
For motor imagery feature extraction, the 30 channels shown 
in Fig. 3 were used without further channel selection. The EEG 
data were band-pass filtered using a fifth order Butterworth 
band pass filter from 8 to 30 Hz, since this frequency band 
included the range of frequencies that were mainly involved in 
performing motor imagery. 
The CSP algorithm is an efficient feature extraction 
algorithm, which has been widely used in MI based BCI 
systems [44-47]. CSP is based on the simultaneous 
diagonalization of two covariance matrices. It finds a spatial 
filter to maximize variance for one class and minimize variance 
for another class at the same time to improve classification.  
 
E. Classification scheme  
A support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning 
method proposed in the 1990s [48]. It is mainly proposed for 
two class pattern recognition problems. For a given data set

i is called slack variables and c is regularization 
parameter. c is used to control the trade-off between the model 
complexity and empirical risk [50]. 10*10-fold cross 
validations accuracy of the data were used for each subject. 
F. Subjective report  
After completing each session, each subject was asked a 
question about the paradigm: Was this paradigm hard? The 
question could be answered on a 1-5 Likert scale indicating 
strong disagreement, moderate disagreement, neutrality, 
moderate agreement, or strong agreement.

Fig.5. This figure displays the averaged spectra of two different paradigms at C3 and C4 (blue: right hand, black: left hand). For each paradigm, the maps are 
averaged across all ten subjects. 
III. RESULTS 
Different articles have presented different thresholds for BCI 
“efficiency” [51]. Since we used subjects who were new to 
motor imagery BCIs, we used a low threshold. Four subjects 
attained accuracies less than 60% in both paradigms. These 
subjects were not selected for further analysis. Ultimately, 
results from ten subjects are shown below. 
A. EEG results 
To illustrate the differences between two classes of motor 
imagery in the writing task paradigm, power spectral densities 
(PSDs) were calculated from the average data, plotted in Fig.4. 
Each map was based on 100 averaged trials (50 left hand motor 
imagery trials and 50 right hand motor imagery trials) after 
being filtered by 8-30 Hz band pass filter.

Fig. 5 presents the PSDs averaged across all ten subjects 
from two different paradigms at C3 and C4. For the writing task 
paradigm, the energy from right hand motor imagery was lower 
than left hand motor imagery at C3, and the energy from left 
hand motor imagery was lower than right hand motor imagery 
at C4. In the beta band, signals from right hand motor imagery 
were higher than left hand motor imagery at both channels. For 
the traditional arrow paradigm, signals from right hand motor 
imagery were higher than left hand motor imagery at C3, while 
there was no significant difference of two classes of MI tasks at 
C4. 
In CSP method, W is the projection matrix, and W-1 is the 
inverse matrix of W. The columns of W-1 are the time invariant 
vectors of EEG source distribution vectors called common 
spatial patterns [52]. The first and last common spatial patterns 
are shown in Fig. 6. The first pattern was obtained by 
maximizing the variance of the right hand motor imagery, 
which was associated with the ERD phenomenon over the area 
of the left sensorimotor area of the cortex. Accordingly, the 
ERD phenomenon over the right motor area was associated 
with the last pattern, corresponding to the left hand motor 
imagery. 
Results in Fig. 6 show that, for the writing task paradigm, 
spatial discriminability of right and left hand motor imagery 
was apparent. Maps also indicated that areas around channel C3 
and C4 were associated with the left and right hand motor 
imageries, which was consistent with the neurophysiology 
phenomenon reported in [53-54]. Results of the traditional 
arrow paradigm did not show clear pattern from the contra 
lateral hemisphere for left and right motor imagery. ERS 
phenomena were also observed during left hand motor imagery 
in the writing task paradigm. 
B. Classification Performance Comparison  
For each of the two paradigms, a 10×10-fold cross-validation 
was implemented to evaluate the classification performance. 
The classification accuracies of all ten subjects from both 
paradigms are shown in Fig. 7. Results showed that the 
classification accuracies of the new writing task paradigm were 
better than the traditional arrow paradigm for all subjects. The 
average classification accuracy of writing task paradigm was

79.8%, which was 14.7% higher than traditional arrow 
paradigm (65.1%). Among all ten subjects, S5 achieved the 
greatest improvement by using the writing task paradigm 
(increased by 26%). 
A paired samples T-Test was used to show the classification 
accuracy differences between the writing task paradigm and 
traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). It showed the 
classification accuracy was increased significantly by using our 
new paradigm compared to the traditional paradigm. 
C.  Subjective report 
Ten subjects’ responses to the question about task difficulty 
are shown in Table 1. The replies are based on a 1-5 Likert scale 
to indicate strong disagreement, moderate disagreement, 
neutrality, moderate agreement, or strong agreement. In the 
comparison of difficulty, significant differences were found 
between the two paradigms (p=0.0026). 
 
IV. DISCUSSION 
The primary goal of this study was to investigate whether the 
new paradigm presented in this paper could help subjects in a 
motor imagery (MI) BCI. Two paradigms were compared in 
our experiment. The results showed that the writing task 
paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the 
traditional arrow paradigm. 
Fig.4 displays the averaged spectra of the two motor imagery 
tasks in the writing task paradigm. Several points stand out: (1) 
For channel C3, the power during right hand motor imagery 
was lower than left hand motor imagery in the band around 
8-12 Hz. (2) For channel C4, the power during left hand motor 
imagery was lower than right hand motor imagery in the band 
around 8-12 Hz. Activity in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) is called 
the Mu rhythm, which is recorded at rest and attenuated by 
voluntary movements. Research initially suggested that the Mu 
rhythm is an ‘‘idling’’ rhythm in the motor cortex [55, 56]. 
However, Mu rhythm activation has been also reported during 
the execution of different tasks. As reported in [43], the 
Mu-rhythm is task sensitive, and can change based on motor 
imagery in the motor cortex. 
The traditional arrow paradigm instructs subjects to perform 
a corresponding MI tasks, and subjects imagined a movement 
they prefer. Subject S1, S2, S4, S5, S8 and S9 reported that they 
imagined grasping an object using the left or right hand in this 
paradigm. Subjects S3 and S10 imagined lifting a dumbbell. 
Subject S6 imagined shaking hands with other people. Subject 
S7 imagined boxing. Hence, the user-selected imagery was not 
consistent across the ten subjects in the traditional arrow 
paradigm. Many subjects reported that they thought that 
imagining the same movement every time would make them 
bored and tired, and could cause them to lose focus. Performing 
different tasks could reduce boredom. However, some subjects 
thought that it would be difficult to imagine different 
movements in different trials. In the writing task paradigm, 
different characters were displayed in different trials. This task 
was also very simple and highly practiced: imagining writing. 
Subjects' responses to the questionnaires indicated that they 
thought that the writing task paradigm could help them focus 
their attention and reduce fatigue. Table 1 shows that the 
subject S5 considered the new paradigm much easier and more 
comfortable. Concordantly, S5 exhibited the greatest difference 
between the two paradigms (26%), shown in Fig. 7. Table 1 
indicates that S4 thought that both paradigms are easy, and he 
performed well in both paradigms (89% in the writing task 
paradigm and 77% in the traditional arrow paradigm).  
Although this study involving 10 subjects yielded good 
performance using a novel motor imagery paradigm in a BCI, 
further work is needed. After the experiment, some subjects 
said that imagining writing with the left hand made them feel 
awkward (all subjects were right handed). Some other subjects 
said that they imagined writing the strokes in a different 
sequence when they wrote with the left hand. They prefer to 
imagine the characters as abstract symbols and copy them. 
Although this did not appear to affect their task performance, it 
will be interesting to find the differences in brain patterns for 
these different subject states. 
Future work could also explore the comparison between 
user-selected imagery and experimenter-defined imagery. 
While the approach used by Wolpaw and colleagues 
encourages subjects to explore different mental strategies for 
control, the approach from Pfurtscheller and colleagues 
adopted by other groups generally does not. Future work could 
further study the relative merits of these two approaches to 
motor imagery for different users.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, we introduced a new motor imagery based BCI 
paradigm using Chinese characters as visual cues, which we 
hypothesized would help subjects perform two MI tasks: 
writing the character with the right or left hand. Experimental 
results based on ten healthy subjects demonstrated that this new 
paradigm yielded significantly better classification accuracies 
than the conventional paradigm using arrows as visual cues 
(p<0.001). Furthermore, most subjects thought that the new 
paradigm was easier, based on their questionnaire responses. 
Future work will focus on simplifying the characters to shorten 
the time required to complete the imagined task, and 
experiments with online feedback.
