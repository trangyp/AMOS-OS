QuotationFinder – Searching for Quotations and Allusions in 
Greek and Latin Texts and Establishing the Degree to Which a 
Quotation or Allusion Matches Its Source

Abstract 
The software programs generally used with the TLG (Thesaurus Linguae Graecae) [http1] and the 
CLCLT (CETEDOC Library of Christian Latin Texts) [http2] CD-ROMs are not well suited for find-
ing quotations and allusions. QuotationFinder [http3] uses more sophisticated criteria as it ranks search 
results based on how closely they match the source text, listing search results with literal quotations 
first and loose verbal parallels last.  
 
keywords 
quotation; allusion; Greek; Latin; antiquity; search 
 
INTRODUCTION 
When looking for Greek and Latin quotations or allusions using standard search functions, a 
search with a Boolean “or” would yield too many matches. A search with a Boolean “and,” 
however, would yield too few, as ancient authors often left out words when quoting without 
us having a chance to know in advance which ones they would keep. QuotationFinder pro-
duces better search results by using five criteria for determining if a given text is a quotation 
or an allusion: number and forms of words matched, their proximity to each other, how rare 
they are, and in what sequence they occur. 
 
I QUOTING IN ANTIQUITY 
 
Designing software algorithms for finding quotations and allusions is not as straightforward 
as it may seem. In antiquity, authors did not use quotation marks or italics (though copyists or 
editors may have added these,) so that there is no simple obvious token in the text that search 
software could work with. In some contexts, one single word that the target and the source 
text have in common may suffice to constitute an allusion – for example if the context in the 
target names the source text, its author, the character originally uttering the word, or a phrase 
like “as it is written” (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015] p. 26-27, [Plett, 1991] p. 9.) Authors may quote 
verbatim or they may assimilate the material to the target context (cf. [Plett 1988] p. 70-71.) 
Variations regarding syntax and semantics may occur – omissions, additions, changes in word 
forms, substitutions of words, etc. (cf. [Plett, 1991] p. 9.) 
Formally, quotations vary greatly from each other (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015] p. 25.39.) Quota-
tion search engines should not be rigid in the way they look for formal features typical of 
quotations. The best approach seems to be to establish a score for every feature and rank po-
tential quotations and allusions based on the sum of the scores they achieve regarding each of 
the features (cf. [Tischer, 2010] p. 103-106.)

II RANKING PROSPECTIVE QUOTATIONS AND ALLUSIONS 
 
2.1 Quantity 
QuotationFinder establishes a score for every potential quotation or allusion as the text en-
tered in the search form is matched against the collected ancient texts (the contents of the 
TLG or CLCLT.) The first parameter QuotationFinder uses is quantitative: Every word in the 
source (search text entered) gets points as it is matched in the target (set number of lines con-
tained in the TLG/CLCLT.) If a word occurs n times in the source, it gets points n times as it 
is matched in the target. This means that if the word occurs only once in the source, but mul-
tiple times in the target, it still only gets points once (otherwise, special texts like entries in 
Suda, the 10th century encyclopedia, would get too many points.)  
 
2.2 Quality 
When ranking matches, QuotationFinder awards 3 points when the exact form of the word in 
the source text (entered in the search form) is found in the target (TLG/CLCLT). If there is a 
match for the same word, but in a different form (case, number, tense, etc.), 2 points are 
awarded. 1 point is given when the match is not the same word, but is derived from the same 
root or stem, or a synonym. (User enters roots, stems, synonyms in dedicated search fields.) 
 
2.3 Rarity 
If a rare word is matched in the target text, it is much more likely that we have found a quota-
tion than if a ubiquitous word has been matched. Comparing the relative rarity of the word 
matched, QuotationFinder awards between 0 and 1 point per match. (User enters frequency 
information provided by TLG/CLCLT.) 
 
2.4 Density 
If a target paragraph contains more than one match, but the words matched are wide apart in 
our source text, we are far less likely to have found a quotation than if the matched words 
originally occur one after the other. This becomes more relevant the longer the search text is. 
The number of points a match is awarded for density is 1 divided by the number of words 
inserted between matched words plus 1. 
 
2.5 Order 
In the target text, the more the sequence of matched words resembles the sequence of these 
words in the source text, the higher the target text is to move up in the ranking. The number of 
points awarded per matched word is 1 divided by the number of words the match has 
“strayed” from its position in the source text plus 1. 
 
2.6 Further Remarks 
The density and order calculations are not trivial. As we can never know in advance which 
ones of our source text’s words are going to be matched in the target text (as the author quot-
ing may leave out any of them,) we cannot use any of their positions as reference points. So, 
QuotationFinder has to establish a “core” of the potential quotation first in order to gain a 
basis for these calculations. It does so by determining where in the target text the position of 
the matched words relative to each other most resembles the relative position of these words 
in the search text. 
During development, by a process of trial and error, the relation of the points awarded for 
quantity, quality, rarity, density, and order was fine-tuned so as to establish a convincing rank 
order from exact quotation to loose verbal parallel. It proved useful to add up the points for

quantity, quality and rarity, divide the sum by 3, then add the points for density multiplied 
times 2, and finally add the points for order. 
QuotationFinder was no longer updated after 2008 as the TLG ceased to be published on CD-
ROM, becoming an online only resource in a different data format ([http1] — the CLCLT is 
now available as part of the LLT DVD [http2].) Some of the ideas presented in this article 
may be of use as new software searching for quotations and allusions is developed. The 
QuotationFinder code (Perl CGI) is available on GitHub [http4]. 
 
Conclusion 
In antiquity, people were not as strict as modern scholars in terms of the precision with which 
one was expected to follow the source when quoting (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015], p. 34.) Classi-
cal authors may or may not provide explicit markers in their texts helping readers to note that 
they are quoting from or alluding to prior texts. When designing search software, it seems best 
to take into account a wide range of features indicative of quotations and allusions — like the 
number and forms of words matched, their proximity to each other, how rare they are, and in 
what sequence they occur, as was done with QuotationFinder.
