Abstract 
The past 15 years have seen an astonishing increase in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) sensitivity 
and accessible pressure range in high-pressure NMR experiments, owing to a series of new 
developments of NMR spectroscopy applied to the diamond anvil cell (DAC). Recently, with the 
application of electro-magnetic lenses, so-called Lenz lenses, in toroidal diamond indenter cells, 
pressures of up to 72 GPa with NMR spin sensitivities of about 1012 spin/Hz1/2 has been achieved. Here, 
we describe the implementation of a refined NMR resonator structure using a pair of double stage 
Lenz lenses driven by a Helmholtz coil within a standard DAC, allowing to measure sample volumes as 
small as 100 pl prior to compression. With this set-up, pressures close to the mega-bar regime (1 Mbar 
= 100 GPa) could be realised repeatedly, with enhanced spin sensitivities of about 5x1011 spin/Hz1/2. 
The manufacturing and handling of these new NMR-DACs is relatively easy and straightforward, which 
will allow for further applications in physics, chemistry, or biochemistry. 
 
Introduction 
Varying thermodynamic conditions opens the 
possibility of accessing low-energy configurations, 
metastable or new states of matter, allowing the 
investigation of electronic or structural instabilities in 
solids. Thus, variation of pressure – that is directly 
reducing atomic or molecular distances – turned out 
to yield one of the most intriguing branches in 
condensed matter sciences [1], [2]. 
One of the most popular devices to generate high 
pressure is the diamond anvil cell (DAC) based on the 
Bridgman concept of a piston-cylinder press type. It 
was first introduced in the mid-fifties [3], and uses 
two diamond anvils to push together and compress a 
sample placed between their flattened faces. Since 
these first pioneering works many developments 
have been implemented such as the introduction of 
gaskets to confine the sample, pressure scale, 
pressure transmitting medium, laser heating. For the 
past two decades, it has now become a near routine 
to generate high pressure of 100 GPa in the 
laboratory, even reaching pressure found at the 
centre of the Earth [4], [5] and beyond [6], [7]. The 
success of the diamond anvil cells (DACs) resides in its 
astonishing variability in both design and field of 
application. To this end, in-situ spectroscopic 
methods in DACs are established, exploiting the 
diamonds’ transparency to a broad range of 
wavelengths using lasers or X-Ray spectroscopy 
techniques covering most of the available pressure 
range. Other spectroscopic methods such as NMR or 
EPR, however, appear to be almost impossible to 
implement in DACs due to the following reasons: i) 
Sample cavities in DACs are typically tightly 
surrounded by both diamonds and a hard, metallic 
disc serving as a gasket. The gasket prevents the 
sample from leaving the region of the highest 
pressures, and provides so-called “massive support” 
to the stressed diamond anvils [8]. ii) Due to the 
necessarily small dimensions of the diamond anvils, 
available sample space is often much less than 5 nl 
before compression, which is further reduced when 
pressures exceeding several GPa are targeted. An 
application above 40 GPa, for example, requires an 
initial sample cavity of about 100 µm diameter and 
about 40 µm in height, amounting to about 350 pl. iii) 
Finally, the sample cavity is prone to plastic 
deformation under compression, leading to a volume 
reduction of the cavity of up to 50 % within a rather

Both first and second stage LL are made from a 1 to 2 µm thick 
layer of copper deposited using PVD and cut into the depicted 
shape using a FIB. The driving coil, an 8-turn coil made from

metallic anvil support (not shown). For further details, see text.

small pressure range, depending on the choice of 
gasket material and pressure medium [9]. 
Thus, a successful implementation of NMR - or pulsed 
ESR for that matter – in diamond anvil cells, requires 
the implementation of resonators with suitable sizes 
and design. The first attempts have employed 
complex coil arrangements, either placed on the 
diamonds pavilion or over the whole diamond 
assembly, but did not allow measurements for 
pressures above 3 to 5 GPa [10]. A more promising 
solution has been the implementation of RF micro-
coils directly into the high pressure sample chamber 
with measurements reaching pressures of up to 8 
GPa [11], [12] and maximal pressures as high as 20 to 
30 GPa [13], [14]. However, these minuscule micro-
coils are extremely sensitive to the plastic 
deformation of the sample cavity, often exhibiting 
significant 
losses 
of 
B1 
field 
strength 
and 
subsequently NMR sensitivity by almost two orders of 
magnitude within a single pressure run [15], [16]. 
Recently, the application of electro-magnetic Lenz 
lenses 
in 
toroidal 
diamond 
indenter 
cells 
demonstrated that NMR at significantly higher 
pressures is not only feasible, but also comparatively 
easy to implement [17]. The basic principle of these 
magnetic flux tailoring devices is governed by Lenz’s 
law of induction, hence the name Lenz lens (LL). 
Resonators using such LLs are typically driven by a 
bigger excitation coil directly connected to the NMR 
spectrometer. Following an RF pulse into the driving 
coil, the LL picks up the RF field via mutual 
inductance. The induced RF current is built up in the 
outer winding of the LL resonator and deposited in an 
inner region via a counter-winding, leading to a 
significant amplification of B1 in a pre-defined 
volume. This basic idea of course makes LL resonators 
in DACs very attractive, as they can be used to focus 
the RF B1 field where the high-pressure sample is 
located. 
However, the latest design introduced by Meier et al. 
displayed some drawbacks. Its application in a DAC 
requires two diamond anvils with different culet 
diameter with, typically an 800 µm culet diamond on 
the cylinder side facing a 250 µm culet diamond on 
the piston side exerting the actual force. The main 
advantage of this technique is that the metallic 
rhenium gasket is buckled towards the much sharper 
piston anvil, leaving the space close to the 800 µm 
mostly untouched. This leaves enough room to place 
the RF excitation coil on the pavilion of the base anvil 
close to the culet, and thus to the 600 µm outer 
diameter LL used in these experiments. However, 
such anvil arrangements limit the accessible pressure 
range [18], with anvils damaged at a much smaller 
pressure range, often 60% below the standard 
capabilities of DAC experiments. Here, we introduce 
a new design and fabrication of RF resonators 
allowing for a further increase in maximal pressures 
and NMR sensitivity. 
 
Structure and preparation of the DSLL-resonator 
 
Figure 1 shows the principle design idea of the 
double-stage LL (DSLL) resonator.  
The pressure cells equipped with these resonators 
were prepared as follows: After careful alignment of 
two 250 µm culet diamond anvils, a 250 µm thick 
rhenium disc was pre-indented to ~20 µm thickness. 
A ~80 µm sample hole was cut in the centre of the 
pre-indentation using an automated laser-drilling 
system at BGI.  
PVD coating of the diamonds has been performed 
using a Dreva Arc 400 (manufacturer: VTD). 
An ultrapure copper target from Chempur (99.999 %) 
has been used. Argon (0.01 mbar) served as 
processing gas for plasma sputtering. The power of 
the Pinnacle magnetron power supply was set at 300 
W. In order to achieve the required thickness of the 
copper layer (~ 2 µm) the duration of the coating 
process was set to 20 minutes. Using a focused ion 
beam (Scios Dual beam from FEI), the shape of the 
DSLL resonator was cut out from the almost 
homogeneous copper layer, using a 30 kV beam 
accelerator voltage and 65 nA gallium ion beam 
current. 
 Figure 2 shows SEM images during the DSLL 
resonator preparation on one of the diamond anvils. 
Additionally, the rhenium gaskets were covered with 
a 1 µm layer of Al2O3 on both sides providing electrical 
insulation between the lenses and the metallic 
gasket. 
Figure 2: Representative SEM images of the DSLL resonator 
structure. The complete anvil can be seen on the left, 
incorporating both 1st and 2nd stage Lenz lenses. The slit in the 
1st stage LL on the anvils pavilion is about 15 µm at its smallest 
point and increases a bit due to divergence of the gallium ion 
beam during cutting. The close up (right) shows the 2nd stage LL 
in detail. Bright spots on both photos are due to small dirt 
particles.

the assembly is symmetric, only the one half is shown.

The excitation coils were prepared from 100 µm PTFE 
insulated copper wire and consisted of 8 turns with a 
diameter of 4 mm. Both coils were placed on the 
backing plates of the diamonds, fully enclosing the 
anvils.  Subsequently, the prepared anvils were 
aligned again in the DACs, and the cells were loaded 
with distilled water and slightly closed to prevent 
water leakage. 
After the cells were closed, both coils were connected 
in order to form a Helmholtz arrangement. The 
loaded and pressurised cells were then mounted on a 
home built NMR probe for standard wide-bore 
magnets. Analysing the return-loss spectrum of the 
resonator at 400 MHz, a quality factor of the 
resonance circuit of about 40 was found.  
All measurements were conducted at a magnetic field 
of 9 T. The actual pressure in the sample cavity was 
monitored using the first derivative of the pressure 
dependent first order Raman vibron mode taken at 
the centre of the diamonds’ culets [19],[20]. 
 
Analysis of NMR performance and stability at 
90 GPa 
 
As a first step, numerical simulations of the RF B1 field 
of the DSLL resonator have been conducted using the 
FEMM software package[21]. Figure 3 shows the 
simulation results for one half of the full assembly, 
taking into account all parts of the high pressure 
resonator, including both LLs placed on one anvil, one 
half of the Helmholtz coil, and the electrically 
insulated rhenium gasket. As can be seen, application 
of the DSLL resonator leads to a focusing effect of the 
B1 field strength due to significant reduction in the 
final diameter of the resonator. In the 100 pl sample 
cavity, the B1 field varies between 2.5 mT at the 
centre up to 5 mT at the inner circumference of the 
2nd stage LLs at  40 µm from the centre. A solitary 
application of the Helmholtz coil would only amount 
to magnetic fields of about 0.8 to 1.1 mT at the high 
pressure centre (simulations are not shown).  
Using RF nutation experiments at 90 GPa, an optimal 
90° pulse length of tπ/2=2.5 µs at 10 W average pulse 
power was found, leading to an actual B1 field 
strength of B1 = π/(γntπ/2)= 2.3 mT, which is in 
excellent agreement with the found values from the 
numerical simulation.  
Estimating the sensitivity of this new resonator, the 
common definition of the time-domain limit of 
detection (LODt) as the minimal necessary number of 
spins, resonating in a 1 Hz bandwidth and providing a 
single-shot SNR of unity in the time domain, is used.  
Figure 4 shows data from a solid echo train recorded 
at 90 GPa of compressed H2O, well within the stability 
field of ice X [22]. At pulse separations of 20 µs, a 
single shot SNR of 39 recorded with a bandwidth of 
2 MHz could be achieved. Considering a number of 
approximately 3∙1016 1H nuclei present within the 
100 pl cavity, a LODt of about 5x1011 spin/Hz1/2 was 
found. Additional investigations of LODt over the 
entire pressure range from 8 GPa to 90 GPa did not 
display any deviations in the spin sensitivities 
exceeding 2% of this value. A thorough analysis the of 
behaviour of high pressure ices VII and X will be 
presented elsewhere [23].  
Another important point for the characterisation of a 
high pressure resonator is its ability to withstand high 
mechanical stresses and deformation under load. 
Figure 5 depicts both recorded Raman spectra at the 
Figure 4: Recorded π/2-τ- π/2 solid echo train of high 
pressure ice X at 90 GPa. The spectrometer was blanked off 
for 4.6 µs after the second 90° pulse (grey area). The inset

diamond edge, as well as X-ray transmission 
measurements performed by scanning the X-ray 
intensity along a fixed axis across the high pressure 
region of the DAC. As can be seen, the diamond anvils 
become highly stressed at increasing pressures, 
leading to a significant line broadening of the Raman 
vibron mode.  The transmission X-ray profile shows 
both diamond anvils clearly cupped at 90 GPa – as can 
be seen by the increased X-ray absorption in the 
region between the sample cavity and the culet, 
which is at about 25-125 µm.  In fact, the equality of 
X-ray intensity at the culet edge and within the 
sample cavity signifies the diamonds almost touching: 
further increase of pressure would not be possible 
without diamond breakage. Interestingly, both the 
cavity diameter as well as the inner diameter of the 
2nd stage LLs at the diamond culet did not decrease 
significantly from their initial values.  
Both 2nd stage LLs where found to be intact even at 
90 GPa pressure at the centre of the DAC, as can be 
seen in the photograph in figure 4B. This is in stark 
contrast to the previously used LLs made from 5 µm 
thick Au-foil, all of which displayed pressure 
dependent deformation at pressures exceeding 
about 19 GPa.  
 
Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The presented DSLL-resonator for high-pressure NMR 
applications exhibits several significant advances 
compared to previous set-ups. First, these novel 
resonators allow for a stable and safe use in a 
standard DAC equipped with two diamonds of 
identical culet diameters. As electro-magnetic 
coupling between excitation coils, 1st stage, and 2nd 
stage LLs works sufficiently well, it may be applicable 
for even smaller culet faces, opening the possibility 
for NMR at even high pressures. This conjecture 
might be confirmed, following some geometric 
reasoning:  
Preparation of the gasket typically follows some 
empirical rules found to maximise the DAC’s stability 
under load, namely that the diameter of the sample 
chamber should be around 1/3 x d, whereas the pre-
indentation is usually as flat as 1/6 x d, where d is the 
culet diameter of the diamond anvils. This sets some 
upper limits for the sample volume V0 prior to 
compression, i.e. V0 ≈ 1.5 ∙ 10-2 ∙ d3.  
Empirical maximal pressures in a standard DAC for 
non-NMR applications was found to be proportional 
to ~d-2 up to about 1.5 Mbar, with a flattening-out of 
this behaviour to roughly a ~d-1/2 dependence above 
this pressure. The inset in figure 6 illustrates these 
dependencies. 
Obviously, the use of smaller diamond anvil culets will 
inevitably reduce both diameter and height of the 
sample cavity. In contrast, the diameter of the 
counter winding as well as the separation between 
both 2nd stage LLs will also be reduced, leading to a 
further increase in B1. Therefore, the inevitable loss in 
SNR due to reduced amount of sample for smaller V0 
and maximal pressures, will be compensated by an 
increase in LODt due to this proximity boost. 
The deduced spin sensitivities of about 1011 spin/Hz1/2 
mark a major advancement in this application field, 
which is illustrated in the main frame of figure 6. 
Here, we summarized extracted data on LODt from 
the majority of all known high-pressure NMR set-ups, 
and compared it to their pressure stability.  
One of the most widely used applications for high 
pressure NMR is bio-chemistry, in particular protein-
folding dynamics [24]–[30], using clamp cells which 
allow for a significantly lower pressure compared to 
standard DACs. LODt values in these cases often range 
between 1 - 3∙1019 spin/Hz1/2 with maximal pressures 
of about 1 GPa. Within DACs, however, three distinct 
groups can be identified from figure 6: external, 
integral, and hybrid resonators.  
External resonators encompass all set-ups introduced 
from the end of the 1980s to 1998, that is resonators 
which are either placed solely on the pavilion of the 
anvils [31]–[35] or single turn cover inductors on top 
of the rhenium gaskets[36], exhibiting LODt of about 
8x1018 to 2x1017 spin/Hz1/2 at pressures as high as 
13 GPa[37]. Internal resonators, on the other hand, 
comprise micro-coils placed directly into the sample 
chamber 
with 
sensitivities 
from 
about 
1x1016 spin/Hz1/2 to 6∙1013 spin/Hz1/2 depending on 
the degree of coil deformation within each pressure 
run.  
The group of hybrid resonators (“hybrid” because 
both external and internal resonators are used 
together), comprise the recently introduced single LL 
in a toroidal diamond indenter cell as well as the 
DSLL-resonator in a DAC, introduced here. From 
figure 6 it is obvious that LODt is not only increased by 
almost eight orders of magnitude compared to clamp 
cell NMR sensitivities but they were also found to be 
exceedingly stable over the entire pressure run, 
originating in the flat, almost two-dimensional design 
of the LLs used.  
Finally, the preparation process of these novel 
resonators could be simplified and developed further 
up to a point enabling a larger number of NMR 
laboratories to use high pressure NMR as an 
convenient everyday investigative tool.
