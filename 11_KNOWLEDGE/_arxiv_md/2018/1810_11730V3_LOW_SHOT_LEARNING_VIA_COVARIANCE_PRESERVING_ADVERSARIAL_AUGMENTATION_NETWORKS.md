Abstract
Deep neural networks suffer from over-ﬁtting and catastrophic forgetting when
trained with small data. One natural remedy for this problem is data augmentation,
which has been recently shown to be effective. However, previous works either
assume that intra-class variances can always be generalized to new classes, or
employ naive generation methods to hallucinate ﬁnite examples without modeling
their latent distributions. In this work, we propose Covariance-Preserving Adver-
sarial Augmentation Networks to overcome existing limits of low-shot learning.
Speciﬁcally, a novel Generative Adversarial Network is designed to model the
latent distribution of each novel class given its related base counterparts. Since
direct estimation of novel classes can be inductively biased, we explicitly preserve
covariance information as the “variability” of base examples during the generation
process. Empirical results show that our model can generate realistic yet diverse
examples, leading to substantial improvements on the ImageNet benchmark over
the state of the art.

Introduction
The hallmark of learning new concepts from very few examples characterizes human intelligence.
Though constantly pushing limits forward in various visual tasks, current deep learning approaches
struggle in cases when abundant training data is impractical to gather. A straightforward idea to learn
new concepts is to ﬁne-tune a model pre-trained on base categories, using limited data from another
set of novel categories. However, this usually leads to catastrophic forgetting [1], i.e., ﬁne-tuning
makes the model over-ﬁtting on novel classes, and agnostic to the majority of base classes [2, 3],
deteriorating overall performance.
One way to address this problem is to augment data for novel classes. Since generating images could
be both unnecessary [4] and impractical [5] on large datasets, feature augmentation [6, 7] is more
preferable in this scenario. Building upon learned representations [8, 9, 10], recently two variants
of generative models show the promising capability of learning variation modes from base classes
to imagine the missing pattern of novel classes. Hariharan et al. proposed Feature Hallucination
(FH) [11], which can learn a ﬁnite set of transformation mappings between examples in each base
category and directly apply them to seed novel points for extra data. However, since mappings are
enumerable (even in large amount), this model suffers from poor generalization. To address this issue,
Wang et al. [12] proposed Feature Imagination (FI), a meta-learning based generation framework
that can train an agent to synthesize extra data given a speciﬁc task. They circumvented the demand
for latent distribution of novel classes by end-to-end optimization. But the generation results usually
collapse into certain modes. Finally, it should be noted that both works erroneously assume that
intra-class variances of base classes are shareable with any novel classes. For example, the visual
variability of the concept lemon cannot be generalized to other irrelevant categories such as raccoon.

Given an example from a novel class, we translate
examples from related base classes into the target
class for augmentation. Image by [13].
In this work, we propose a new approach to
addressing the problem of low-shot learning
by enabling better feature augmentation be-
yond current limits. Our approaches are novel
in two aspects: modeling and training strat-
egy. We propose Covariance-Preserving Ad-
versarial Augmentation Networks (CP-AAN), a
new class of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN) [14, 15] for feature augmentation. We
take inspiration from unpaired image-to-image
translation [16, 17] and formulate our feature
augmentation problem as an imbalanced set-to-
set translation problem where the conditional
distribution of examples of each novel class can
be conceptually expressed as a mixture of re-
lated base classes. We ﬁrst extract all related
base-novel class pairs by an intuitive yet effec-
tive approach called Neighborhood Batch Sam-
pling. Then, our model aims to learn the latent distribution of each novel class given its base
counterparts. Since the direct estimation of novel classes can be inductively biased during this
process, we explicitly preserve the covariance base examples during the generation process.
We systematically evaluate our approach by considering a series of objective functions. Our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance over the challenging ImageNet benchmark [18]. With
ablation studies, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our method.

Related Works
Low-shot Learning
For quick adaptation when very few novel examples are available, the com-
munity has often used a meta-agent [19] to further tune base classiﬁers [8, 9, 10]. Intuitive yet often
ignored, feature augmentation was recently brought into the ﬁeld by Hariharan et al. [11] to ease the
data scarce scenario. Compared to traditional meta-learning based approaches, they have reported
noticeable improvement on not only the conventional setting (i.e., to test on novel examples only),
but also the more challenging generalized setting (i.e., to test on all classes). Yet the drawback
is that both the original work and its variants [12] fail to synthesize diverse examples because of
ill-constrained generation processes. Our approach falls in this line of research while seeking more
principal guidance from base examples in a selective, class-speciﬁc manner.
Generative Adversarial Network for Set-to-set Translation
GANs [14] map each latent code
from an easily sampled prior to a realistic sample of a complex target distribution. Zhu et al. [16]
have achieved astounding results on image-to-image translation without any paired training samples.
In our case, diverse feature augmentation is feasible through conditional translation given a pair of
related novel and base classes. Yet two main challenges remain: practically, not all examples are
semantically translatable. Second, given extremely scarce data for novel classes, we are unable to
estimate their latent distributions (see Figure 4). In this work, we thoroughly investigate conditional
GAN variants inspired by previous works [5, 15, 17, 20] to enable low-shot generation. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel batch sampling technique for learning salient set-to-set mappings using unpaired
data with categorical conditions.
Generation from Limited Observations
Estimation of latent distribution from a handful of
observations is biased and inaccurate [21, 22]. The Bayesian approaches aim to model latent
distributions of a variety of classes as hierarchical Gaussian mixture [23], or alternatively model
generation as a sequential decision making process [24]. For GANs, Gaussian mixture noise has
also been incorporated for latent code sampling [25]. Recent works [26, 27] on integral probability
metrics provide theoretical guidance towards the high order feature matching. In this paper, building
upon the assumption that related classes should have similar intra-class variance, we introduce a new
loss term for preserving covariance during the translation process.

Imbalanced Set-to-set Translation
In this section, we formulate our low-shot feature augmentation problem under an imbalanced set-
to-set translation framework. Concretely, we are given two labeled datasets represented in the same
D-dimensional semantic space: (1) a base set B = {(xb, yb) | xb ∈RD, yb ∈Yb} consisting of
abundant samples and (2) a novel set N = {(xn, yn) | xn ∈RD, yn ∈Yn} with only a handful of
observations. Their discrete label spaces are assumed to be non-overlapping, i.e., Yb ∩Yn = ∅. Our
goal is to learn a mapping function Gn : B 7→N in order to translate examples of the base classes
into novel categories. After the generation process, a ﬁnal classiﬁer is trained using both original
examples of the base classes and all (mostly synthesized) examples of the novel classes.
Existing works [11, 12] suffer from the use of arbitrary, and thus possibly unrelated, base classes
for feature augmentation. Moreover, their performances are degraded by naive generation methods
without modeling the latent distribution of each novel class. Our insight, conversely, is to sample
extra features from continuous latent distributions rather than certain modes from enumerations, by
learning a GAN model (see Figure 2).
Speciﬁcally, we address two challenges that impede good translation under imbalanced scenarios: (1)
through which base-novel class pairs we can translate; and more fundamentally, (2) through what
objectives for GAN training we can estimate the latent distribution of novel classes with limited
observations. We here start by proposing a straightforward batch sampling technique to address
the ﬁrst problem. Then we suggest a simple extension of existing methods and study its weakness,
which motivates the development of our ﬁnal approach. For clarity, we introduce a toy dataset for
imbalanced set-to-set translation in Figure 3 as a conceptual demonstration of the proposed method
compared to baselines.
3.1
Neighborhood Batch Sampling
It is widely acknowledged [28, 8, 9] that a metric-learned high dimensional space encodes relational
semantics between examples. Therefore, to deﬁne which base classes are translatable to a novel class,
we can rank them by their distance in a semantic space. For simplicity, we formulate our approach on
top of Prototypical Networks [9], learned by the nearest neighbor classiﬁer on the semantic space
measured by the Euclidean distance. We represent each class y as a cluster and encode its categorical
information by the cluster prototype ly ∈RD:
ly =
P
i xi · 1[yi=y]
P
i 1[yi=y]
(1)
It should be noted that by “prototype” we mean the centroid of examples of a class. It should not be
confused with the centroid of randomly sampled examples that is computed in each episode to train
original Prototypical Networks.
We introduce translation mapping R : Yn 7→P(Yb) where P(Yb) is the powerset of the collection
of all base classes. This deﬁnes a many-to-many relationship between novel and base classes, and

which consists of two base classes (top, bottom) and two novel classes (left, right). Novel classes are
colored with lower saturation to indicate they are not available for training. Instead, only 4 examples
(black crosses) are available. Generated samples are colored with higher saturation than the real
data. (b): c-GAN; note that we also show the results of translating synthesized novel samples back to

is used to translate data from selected base classes to each novel class. To this end, given a novel
class yn, we compute its similarity scores α with all base classes yb using softmax over Euclidean
distances between prototypes,
α(yb, yn) =
exp (−∥lyb −lyn∥2
2)
P
y′
b∈Yb exp (−∥ly′
b −lyn∥2
2)
(2)
This results in a soft mapping (NBS-S) between base and novel classes, in which each novel
class is paired with all base classes with soft scores. In practice, translating from all base classes
is unnecessary, and computationally expensive. Alternatively, we consider a hard version of R
based on k-nearest neighbor search, where the top k base classes are selected and treated as equal
(α(yb, yn) = 1/k). This hard mapping (NBS-H) saves memory, but introduces an extra hyper-
parameter.
3.2
Adversarial Objective
After constraining our translation process to selected class pairs, we develop a baseline based on
Conditional GAN (c-GAN) [15]. To this end, a discriminator Dn is trained to classify real examples
as the corresponding N = |Yn| novel classes, and classify synthesized examples as an auxiliary
“fake” class. [5]. The generator Gn takes an example from base classes R(yn) that are paired with yn
via NBS, and aims to fool the discriminator into classifying the generated example as yn instead of
the “fake”. More speciﬁcally, the adversarial objective can be written as:
Ladv(Gn, Dn, B, N) = Eyn∼Yn

Exn∼Nyn

log Dn(yn|xn)

(3)
+ Exb,yb∼BR(yn)

α(yb, yn) log Dn(N + 1|Gn(yn; xb, yb))

(4)
where Nyn consists of all novel examples labeled with yn in N while BR(yn) consists all base
examples labeled by one of the classes in R(yn).
We train c-GAN by solving the minimax game of the adversarial loss. In this scenario, there is no
explicit way to incorporate base classes intra-class variance into the generation of new novel examples.
Also, any mappings that collapse synthesized features into existing observations yield the optimal
solution [14]. These facts lead to unfavorable generation results as shown in Figure 3b. We next
explore different ways to explicitly force the generator to learn the latent conditional distributions.

single cat image during training. (a): conventional models can easily fail since there are inﬁnite
candidate distributions that cannot be discriminated; (b): related classes should have similar intra-
class variances. Thus, we preserve covariance information during translation, to transfer knowledge
from base classes to novel ones.
3.3
Cycle-consistency Objective
A natural idea for preventing modes from getting dropped is to apply the cycle-consistency constraint
whose effectiveness has been proven over image-to-image translation tasks [16]. Besides extra
supervision, it eliminates the demand for paired data, which is impossible to acquire for the low-
shot learning setting. We extend this method for our conditional scenario and derive cCyc-GAN.
Speciﬁcally, we learn two generators: Gn, which is our main target, and Gb : N 7→B as an auxiliary
mapping that reinforces Gn. We train the generators such that, the translation cycle recovers the
original embedding in either a forward cycle N 7→B 7→N or a backward cycle B 7→N 7→B. Our
cycle-consistency objective could then be derived as,
Lcyc(Gn, Gb) =Eyn∼Yn

(6)
where a Z-dimensional noise vector sampled from a distribution Z is injected into Gb’s input since
novel examples xn lack variability given the very limited amount of data. Z is a normal distribution
N(0, 1) for our cCyc-GAN model.
While Gn is hard to train due to the extremely small data volume; Gb has more to learn from,
and can thus indirectly guide Gn through its gradient. During our experiments, we found that
cycle-consistency is indispensable for stabilizing the training procedure. Swaminathan et al. [25]
observe that incorporating extra noise from a mixture of Gaussian distributions could result in more
diverse results. Hence, we also report a variant called cDeLi-GAN which uses the same objective as
cCyc-GAN, but sample the noise vector z from a mixture of C different Gaussian distributions,

where f(z|µ, Σ) = exp(−1

(7)
We follow the initialization setup in the previous work [25]. For each µ, we sample from a uniform
distribution U(−1, 1). And for each Σ, we ﬁrst sample a vector σ from a Gaussian distribution
N(0, 0.2), then we simply set Σ = diag(σ)
Generation results of the two aforementioned methods are shown in Figure 3c and 3d. Both methods
improve the diversity of generation compared to the naive c-GAN, yet they either under- or over-
estimate the intra-class variance.

3.4
Covariance-preserving Objective
While cycle-consistency alone can transfer certain degrees of intra-class variance from base classes,
we ﬁnd it rather weak and unreliable since there are still inﬁnite candidate distributions that cannot
be discriminated based on limited observations (See Figure 4).
Building upon the assumption that similar classes share similar intra-class variance, one straightfor-
ward idea is to penalize the change of “variability” during translation. Hierarchical Bayesian models
[23], prescribe each class as a multivariate Gaussian, where intra-class variability is embedded in a
covariance matrix. We generalize this idea and try to maintain covariance in the translation process,
although we model the class distribution by GAN instead of any prescribed distributions.
To compute the difference between two covariance matrices [26], one typical way is to measure
the worst case distance between them using Ky Fan m-norm, i.e., the sum of singular values of
m-truncated SVD, which we denote as ∥[·]m∥∗. To this end, we deﬁne the pseudo-prototype ˆlyn of
each novel class yn as the centroid of all synthetic samples ˆxn = Gn(yn; xb, yb) translated from
related base classes. The covariance distance dcov(yb, yn) between a base-novel class pair can then
be formulated as,
dcov(yb, yn) =


[Σx(Pyb) −ΣG(Pyn)]m


∗, where

ΣG(Py) =

(8)
Consequently, our covariance-preserving objective can be written as the expectation of the weighted
covariance distance using NBS-S,
Lcov(Gn) = Eyn∼Yn

Eyb∼R(yn)

α(yb, yn)dcov(yb, yn)

(9)
Note that, for a matrix X, ∥[X]m∥∗is non-differentiable with respect to itself, thus in practice,
we calculate its subgradient instead. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst compute the unitary matrices U, V by
m-truncated SVD [29], and then back-propagate UVT for sequential parameter updates. Proof of
the correctness is provided in the supplementary material.
Finally, we propose our covariance-preserving conditional cycle-GAN, cCov-GAN, as:
G∗
n = arg min
Gn,Gb max
Dn,DbLadv(Gn, Dn, B, N)
+ Ladv(Gb, Db, N, B) + λcycLcyc(Gn, Gb) + λcovLcov(Gn)
(10)
As illustrated in Figure 3e, preserving covariance information from relevant base classes to a novel
class can improve low-shot generation quality. We attribute this empirical result to the interplay of
adversarial learning, cycle consistency, and covariance preservation, that respectively lead to realistic
generation, semantic consistency, and diversity.
3.5
Training
Following recent works on meta-learning [30, 11, 12], we design a two-stage training procedure.
During the “meta-training” phase, we train our generative model with base examples only, by
mimicking the low-shot scenario it would encounter later. After that, in the “meta-testing” phase,
we are given novel classes as well as their low-shot examples. We use the trained Gn to augment
each class until it has the average capacity of the base classes. Then we train a classiﬁer as one would
normally do in a supervised setting using both real and synthesized data. For the choice of this ﬁnal
classiﬁer, we apply the same one as in the original representation learning stage. For examples, we
use the nearest neighbor classiﬁer for embeddings from Prototypical Networks, and a normal linear
classiﬁer for those from ResNets.
We follow the episodic procedure used by [12] during meta-training. In each episode, we sample
Nb “meta-novel” classes from B, and use the rest of B as “meta-base” classes. Then we sample Kb
6


## Page 7


examples from each meta-novel class as meta-novel examples. We compute the prototypes of each
class and similarity scores between each “meta-novel” and “meta-base” class. To sample a batch of
size B, we ﬁrst include all “meta-novel” examples, and sample B −Nb · Kb examples uniformly
from the “meta-base” classes retrieved by translation mapping R. Next, we push our samples through
generations and discriminators to compute the loss. Finally, we update their weights for the current
episode and start the next one.

Experiments
This section is organized as follows. In Section 4.1, we conduct low-shot learning experiments on the
challenging ImageNet benchmark. In Section 4.2, we further discuss with ablation, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, to better understand the performance gain. We demonstrate our model’s capacity to
generate diverse and reliable examples and its effectiveness in low-shot classiﬁcation.
Dataset
We evaluate our method on the real-world benchmark proposed by Hariharan et al. [11].
This is a challenging task because it requires us to learn a large variety of ImageNet [18] given
a few exemplars for each novel classes. To this end, our model must be able to model the visual
diversity of a wide range of categories and transfer knowledge between them without confusing
unrelated classes. Following [11], we split the 1000 ImageNet classes into four disjoint class
sets Ytest
b
, Ytest
n
, Yval
b
, Yval
n , which consist of 193, 300, 196, 311 classes respectively. All of our
parameter tuning is done on validation splits, while ﬁnal results are reported using held-out test splits.
Evaluation
We repeat sampling novel examples ﬁve times for held-out novel sets and report results
of mean top-5 accuracy in both conventional low-shot learning (LSL, to test on novel classes only)
and its generalized setting (GLSL, to test on all categories including base classes).
Baselines
We compare our results to the exact numbers reported by Feature Hallucination [11]
and Feature Imagination [12]. We also compared to other non-generative methods including classical
Siamese Networks [31], Prototypical Networks [9], Matching Networks [8], and MAML [32] as
well as more recent Prototypical Matching Networks [12] and Attentive Weight Generators [33]. For
stricter comparison, we provide two extra baselines to exclude the bias induced by different embedding
methods: P-FH builds on Feature Hallucinating by substituting their non-episodic representation
with learned prototypical features. Another baseline (ﬁrst row in Table 1), on the contrary, replaces
prototypical features with raw ResNet-10 embeddings. The results for MAML and SN are reported
using their published codebases online.
Implementation details
Our implementation is based on PyTorch [34]. Since deeper networks
would unsurprisingly result in better performance, we conﬁne all experiments in a ResNet-10
backbone1 with a 512-d output layer. We ﬁne-tune the backbone following the procedure described
in [11]. For all generators, we use three-layer MLPs with all hidden layers’ dimensions ﬁxed at
512 as well as their output for synthesized features. Our discriminators are accordingly designed as
three-layer MLPs to predict probabilities over target classes plus an extra fake category. We use leaky
ReLU of slope 0.1 without batch normalization. Our GAN models are trained for 100000 episodes
by ADAM [35] with initial learning rate ﬁxed at 0.0001 which anneals by 0.5 every 20000 episodes.
We ﬁx the hyper-parameter m = 10 for computing truncated SVD. For loss term contributions, we
set λcyc = 5 and λcov = 0.5 for all ﬁnal objectives. We choose Z = 100 as the dimension of noise
vectors for Gb’s input, and C = 50 for the Gaussian mixture. We inject prototype embeddings
instead of one-hot vectors as categorical information for all networks (prototypes for novel classes are
computed using the low-shot examples only). We empirically set batch size B = 1000, and Nb = 20
and Kb = 10 for all training, no matter what would the number of shots be in the test. This is more
efﬁcient but possibly less accurate than [9] who trained separate models for each testing scenario, so
the number of shots in train and test always match. All hyper-parameters are cross-validated on the
validation set using a coarse grid search.

online. We decompose each method into stage-wise operations for breaking performance gain down
to detailed choices made in each stage.
We provide four models constructed with different GAN choices as justiﬁed in Section 3. All of our
introduced CP-AAN approaches are trained with NBS-S which would be further investigated with
ablation in the next subsection. Results are shown in Table 1. Our best method consistently achieves
signiﬁcant improvement over the previous augmentation-based approaches for different values of K
under both LSL and GLSL settings, achieving almost 2% performance gain compared to baselines.
We also notice that apart from overall improvement, our best model achieves its largest boost (˜9%)
at the lowest shot over naive baseline and 2.6% over Feature Imagination (FI) [12] under the LSL
setting, even though we use a simpler embedding technique (PN compared to their PMN). We believe
such performance gain can be attributed to our advanced generation methods since at low shots, FI
applies discrete transformations that its generator has previously learned while we can now sample
through a smooth distribution combining all related base classes’ covariance information.
Note that in the LSL setting, all generative methods assume we still have access to original base
examples when learning ﬁnal classiﬁers while non-generative baselines usually don’t have this
constraint.

Discussions
In this subsection, we carefully examine our design choices for the ﬁnal version of our CP-AAN. We
start by unpacking performance gain over the standard batch sampling procedure and proceed by
showing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on generation quality.
Ablation on NBS
To validate the effectiveness of the NBS strategy over standard batch sampling
for feature augmentation, we conduct an ablation study to show our absolute performance gain in
Figure 5a. In general, we empirically demonstrate that applying NBS improves the performance of
low-shot recognition. We also show that the performance of NBS-H is sensitive to the hyper-parameter
k in the k-nearest neighbor search. Therefore, the soft assignment is preferable if computational
resources allow.
Quantitative Generation Quality
We next quantitatively evaluate the generation quality of the
variants introduced in Section 3 and previous works as shown in Figure 5b. Note that for FH, we used
their published codebase online; for FI, we implemented the network and train with the procedure
described in the original paper. We measure the diversity of generation via the mean average pairwise
Euclidean distance of generated examples within each novel class. We adopt same augmentation
strategies as used for ImageNet experiments. For reference, the mean average Euclidean distance
over real examples is 0.163. In summary, the results are consistent with our expectation and support

our design choices. Feature Hallucination and Imagination show less diversity compared to real data.
Naive c-GAN even under-performs those baselines due to the mode collapse. Cycle-consistency and
Gaussian mixture noise do help generation in both accuracy and diversity. However, they either under-
or over-estimate the diversity. Our covariance-preserving objective leads to the best hallucination
quality, since the generated distribution more closely resembles the real data diversity. Another
insight from Figure 5b is that not surprisingly, under-estimating data diversity is more detrimental to
classiﬁcation accuracy than over-estimating.
Qualitative Generation Quality
Figure 5c, 5d, 5e show t-SNE [37] visualizations of the data
generated by Feature Hallucination, Feature Imagination and our best model in the prototypical
feature space. We ﬁx the number of examples per novel class K = 5 in all cases and plot their real
distribution with translucent point clouds. The 5 real examples are plotted in crosses and synthesized
examples are denoted by stars. Evidently, naive generators could only synthesize novel examples
that are largely pulled together. Although t-SNE might visually drag similar high dimensional points
towards one mode, our model shows more diverse generation results that are better aligned with
the latent distribution, improving overall recognition performance by spreading seed examples in
meaningful directions.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to low-shot learning that augments data for novel
classes by training a cyclic GAN model, while shaping intra-class variability through similar base
classes. We introduced and compared several GAN variants in a logical process and demonstrated
the increasing performance of each model variant. Our proposed model signiﬁcantly outperforms
the state of the art on the challenging ImageNet benchmark in various settings. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations show the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and diverse data
for low-shot learning, given very few examples.

Details about Neighborhood Batch Sampling
In this section, we cover more details in regard to Neighborhood Batch Sampling (NBS). We have
considered two instantiations of the translation mapping R and similarity scores α, based on hard
k-nearest neighbor search and soft selection, respectively. Given a novel class yn, we want to select
the base classes {yb} that are semantically similar to the yn query.
Hard assignments (NBS-H) This sampling method retrieves k uniformly weighted nearest base
classes. NBS-H can be formulated as follows,
R(yn) =
arg min
Y′
b⊂Yb,|Y′
b|=k
X
yb∈Y′
b
∥lyb −lyn∥2
2,
α(yb, yn) = 1
k ∀yb ∈R(yn).
(11)
Similar heuristics are used in previous works [11, 12] as well by introducing a new hyper-parameter
k. Though NBS-H may save computational resources, in practice, we ﬁnd it too sensitive to the
selection of k. In addition to that, it treats all selected base classes as equally related to the target
novel class yn, which slows the convergence and hurts the performance.
Soft assignments (NBS-S) In this case, all base classes are considered, and weighted by the softmax
score over the learned metrics,
R(yn) = Yb,
α(yb, yn) =
exp (−∥lyb −lyn∥2
2)
P
y′
b∈Yb exp (−∥ly′
b −lyn∥2
2).
(12)
Through the ablation study, we showed that this batch sampling technique is more effective than
NBS-H given enough computational resources.

Details about Intermediate GAN Objectives
In this section, we formulate our full objectives for intermediate variants derived for the imbalanced
set-to-set translation.
c-GAN
Its full objective could be deﬁned as a basic minimax game,
G∗
n = arg min
Gn max
Dn Ladv(Gn, Dn, B, N).
(13)
cCyc-GAN
Accordingly, its full objective can be directly derived from cycle-consistency,
G∗
n = arg min
Gn,Gb max
Dn,Db Ladv(Gn, Dn, B, N) + Ladv(Gb, Db, N, B) + λcycLcyc(Gn, Gb).

Details about Computing Subgradient of Ky Fan m-norm
Theorem 1
Given a matrix X and its Ky Fan m-norm ∥[X]m∥∗= P
i σi( ˜X) where ˜X = UΣVT
is the m-truncated SVD and σi(·) is the i-th largest singular value, we have,
d∥[X]m∥∗
dX
= UVT
(15)
Proof
Rewrite Ky Fan m-norm by its sub-differential set,
∥[X]∥∗= tr(Σ) = tr(ΣΣ−1Σ)
(16)
Then,
d∥[X]m∥∗= tr(ΣΣ−1dΣ)
(17)
12


## Page 13


Since we have,
dX = dUΣVT + UdΣVT + UΣdVT
(18)
Therefore,
UdΣVT = dX −dUΣVT −UΣdVT
⇒dΣ = UT dXV −UT dUΣ −ΣdVT V
(19)
By the diagonality of Σ and anti-symmetricity of U, V,
UT dUΣ + ΣdVT V = 0
⇒dΣ = UT dXV
(20)
Substitute it into Equation 17,
d∥[X]m∥∗= tr(ΣΣ−1dΣ) = tr(UT dXV) = tr(UT VdX)
⇒d∥[X]m∥∗
dX
= UVT
