Robustness to fundamental uncertainty in AGI
alignment

Abstract
The AGI alignment problem has a bimodal distribution of outcomes with most outcomes clustering around the poles
of total success and existential, catastrophic failure. Consequently, attempts to solve AGI alignment should, all else
equal, prefer false negatives (ignoring research programs that would have been successful) to false positives (pursu-
ing research programs that will unexpectedly fail). Thus, we propose adopting a policy of responding to points of
philosophical and practical uncertainty associated with the alignment problem by limiting and choosing necessary as-
sumptions to reduce the risk of false positives. Herein we explore in detail two relevant points of uncertainty that AGI
alignment research hinges on—meta-ethical uncertainty and uncertainty about mental phenomena—and show how to
reduce false positives in response to them.
Introduction
The development of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is making possible many technological advance-
ments and improvements to well-being but also exposes humans to considerable risks (Brundage et al.,
2018). Key among these risks are the existential risks associated with artiﬁcial general intelligence
or AGI (Turchin and Denkenberger, 2018). In particular, it is likely that the development of super-
intelligent AGI will create either existential catastrophe or massive beneﬁts for humanity with little
room for mildly bad, mildly good, or neutral outcomes (Bostrom, 2014). This bimodal distribution
of outcomes where one of the outcomes is extremely undesirable implies that we are better off if
we focus more on avoiding negative outcomes and less on achieving positive outcomes, even at the
risk of missing out on much possible positive value (Bostrom, 2003). Thus, assuming AGI will be
built eventually, we can increase the expected value of AGI by working on interventions that re-
duce the chance of existential catastrophe, and we call the ﬁeld that focuses on these interventions
AI safety (Yampolskiy, 2012).
Central among interventions that address AI safety is alignment, the problem of how to build AGI

that is aligned with human interests (Soares and Fallenstein, 2017). The alignment problem is
complex and likely requires solving many open problems in mathematics, economics, computer
science, and philosophy (Yudkowsky, 2016). This is unfortunate from the perspective of increasing
the expected value of AGI by reducing existential risks because it introduces many opportunities
for researchers to make mistakes. If those mistakes are false negatives, like believing an alignment
scheme won’t work when it would, then there is a comparatively small loss of value from failing
to develop safe AGI as soon as possible, but if those mistakes are false positives, like believing an
alignment scheme will work when it won’t, then there is an astronomically large loss of value from
accidentally developing unsafe AGI. This implies that, all else equal, we are better off preferring
false negatives to false positives when working on alignment.
This preference implies several AGI research and development policies. One previously explored
by Yudkowsky is the idea of security mindset, borrowing an idea of the same name from computer
security researcher Bruce Schneier, which we might summarize as the expectation of operating
in an adversarial environment that is actively trying to produce unsafe AGI (Yudkowsky, 2017b).
Another, which we will demonstrate the value of here, might be called robustness to fundamental
uncertainty, the idea that we can reduce false positives by choosing necessary assumptions when
reasoning about alignment such that the chosen assumptions minimize the risk of false positives
among the space of alternative assumptions. We’ll show how to reason about risks from funda-
mental uncertainty by examining two cases relevant to AI alignment—meta-ethical uncertainty and
uncertainty about mental phenomena—and recommend speciﬁc assumptions to reduce the risk of
existential catastrophe from AGI.
Reducing false positive risk
If we wish to reduce false positives in AI alignment research, viz. reduce the chance of accidentally
producing unaligned AGI when we thought we would have produced aligned AGI, we can work
to reduce the overall rate of errors or we can trade-off producing more false negatives against
producing fewer false positives (Neyman and Pearson, 1933). The former is hard to control since
it largely depends on the base error rates of individual researchers, but the the trade-off between
false negatives and false positives may be adjusted by taking actions that prefer one to the other.
For example, to decrease false negatives and increase false positives researchers might try more
ideas they think less likely to work and vice versa to increase false negatives and decrease false
positives. The latter is the sort of approach to reducing false positives one might get in part by
application of Yudkowsky’s ideas around security mindset.
Another approach to reducing the rate of false positives by trading off against false negatives is to
apply the principle of parsimony (also known as Occam’s razor) to decrease the probability of any
particular attempt at producing aligned AGI failing by reducing the number of variables multiplied
together in calculating the probability of success (Pearl, 2000). On the one hand this suggests the
adoption of the well-known engineering principle that simpler systems are less likely to fail, and
on the other suggests we can reduce false positives by making a deep commitment to reducing the

number of variables, especially implicit variables that are often ignored, when building aligned
AGI (Billington and Allan, 1992). We cannot, however, remove all variables from our reasoning.
One cause of our need to reason with irreducible variables is computational because complete
deductive proofs cannot always be found within reasonable time bounds (Leike and Hutter, 2015).
The other, more pernicious cause of this need is the problem of epistemic circularity.
Brieﬂy stated, epistemic circularity is the problem that nothing can be reliably known without
ﬁrst knowing something reliably (Alston, 1986). There have been numerous attempts to solve
epistemic circularity since it was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Pyrrhonian skeptics in ancient Greece via the
Problem of the Criterion, and it remains a key problem in epistemology today because it likely has
no complete solution (Lammenranta, 2003). Instead we are left to adopt the least-bad pragmatic so-
lution, known as particularism, by choosing to assume unreliable entitlements to some knowledge
and then reasoning as if we knew those facts reliably (Chisholm, 1973), (Alston, 1993), (Alston,
2005). This does not fundamentally address the skepticism that epistemic circularity implies, but
it does allow us to contain our skepticism to only a few philosophical assumptions—called hinge
propositions by Wittgenstein, analogous to axioms in formal logics, and related to approximation
of the universal prior in Solomonoff induction—to get on with reasoning in spite of epistemic
circularity (Talvinen, 2009).
Adopting particularism still leaves us with the problem of choosing the speciﬁc assumptions upon
which we will build our reasoning about how to build aligned AGI. Since these choices cannot
be made reliably they stand as “free” variable in our reasoning that we must choose using criteria
other than likelihood of being true since that likelihood cannot be adequately assessed. This need
to choose gives us an opening, though, to choose such that the risk of false positives is reduced by
considering the relative likelihood of false positives given different choices of assumptions. We
will now review some of these assumptions, why they are necessary, and evaluate their expected
impacts on the likelihood of false positives in order to conclude what assumptions are safest to
make.
Necessary assumptions
We have identiﬁed at least two problems, both philosophical and pragmatic, that presently require
making assumptions when reasoning about AGI alignment: meta-ethical uncertainty and uncer-
tainty about mental phenomena. For each problem we consider why making an assumption is
necessary and give arguments in favor of and against particular assumptions in terms of their im-
pact on false positives and likelihood of success in order to determine the safest assumption to
make.
Meta-ethical uncertainty
AGI alignment is typically phrased in terms of aligning AGI with human interests, but this hides
some of the complexity of the problem behind determining what “human interests” are. Taking
3

“interests” as a synonym for the cluster of concepts we also call “values” and “preferences”, we
can begin to make some progress by treating alignment as at least partially the problem of teaching
AGI to learn human values (Soares, 2016), (Arnold et al., 2017). Unfortunately, what constitutes
human values is currently unclear since humans may not be aware of the extent of their own values,
human values may be partial, and humans may not hold reﬂexively consistent or rational values
(Scanlon, 2003), (Pettit, 1991), (Tversky, 1969). This creates a problem in terms of alignment
because the values of individual humans, let alone the combined values of humanity, contradict
each other, so in order for an AGI to align its behavior with human values it must have some way
of resolving those conﬂicts since an AGI is very likely to be modelable as having a utility func-
tion and thus the AGI must meet rationality constraints requiring strong consistency of preferences
(Yudkowsky, 2004). Additionally, it appears that AGI cannot learn human values without making
at least some normative assumptions as a result of a no free lunch theorem in the theory of value
learning that requires assuming norms in order to enable extracting values from observed human
behavior (Armstrong and Mindermann, 2017). Consequently this means alignment requires mak-
ing normative assumptions to resolve value conﬂicts, and doing so means alignment asks us to
tackle the ethical issue of normative uncertainty (MacAskill, 2014).
Normative uncertainty is a symptom of deeper uncertainty in ethics caused by meta-ethical uncer-
tainty about the existence of moral facts because epistemic circularity prevents us from reliably
knowing whether or not moral facts exist, let alone what moral propositions are true if moral facts
exist (Chisholm, 1982). Meta-ethical uncertainty forces us to speculate about moral facts because
knowledge about moral facts, even if it is the knowledge that moral facts do not exist, is necessary
to ground ethical reasoning (Zimmerman, 2010). Thus in order to reason about alignment we must
consider what hinge proposition to adopt about the existence of moral facts in order to be able to
design AGI that can behave in a manner aligned with conﬂicting human values and indeed suc-
cessfully learn human values at all. The standard positions regarding the existence of moral facts
are realism, anti-realism, and skepticism being respectively for, against, and uncertain about their
existence, so we’ll consider their effects on false positives in AGI alignment in turn.
Moral realism
If we suppose realism, then we could build aligned AGI on the presupposition that it could at least
discover moral facts even if no moral facts were speciﬁed in advance and then use knowledge of
these facts to resolve conﬂicts in human values and learn human values. Now suppose this as-
sumption is false and that moral facts do not exist or even if they do exist they cannot be known,
then our moral-facts-assuming AGI would either never discover any moral facts to guide its be-
havior or would assume arbitrary moral propositions to be facts that would not be sure to produce
human-preferred resolutions to value conﬂicts or enable learning human values successfully. Such
an AGI might still achieve de facto alignment with human values if it adopted moral propositions
it believed to be facts that allowed it to converge on a functionally equivalent solution to the one an
AGI that had correctly assumed no knowledge of moral facts would have used, but lacking an ar-
gument suggesting such an AGI would be less likely to result in false positives than a simpler AGI
that started out not assuming knowledge of moral facts, this seems a strictly more risky approach.

## Page 5


To make this argument about the risks of false positives concrete, consider efforts to align a realist
AGI in a world where moral facts do not exist. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that
the AGI believes ”do unto others as you would have them do unto you” or the Golden Rule is a
moral fact contrary to the reality of this world. Believing the Golden Rule to be true, the AGI
resolves conﬂicts between the values of individual humans on its basis, possibly contrary to their
preferences.
For example, Alice may prefer that she and only she eats cake, and Bob may prefer that he and
only he eats pie. Simultaneously, Alice prefers to eat cake to pie, and Bob prefers to eat pie to
cake. This seems ﬁne, since their combined preferences should allow Alice to eat cake and Bob
to eat pie, but by the Golden Rule the AGI may reason Alice does not want to eat cake since she
prefers others not to eat cake and Bob does not want to eat pie since he prefers others not to eat
pie. That is, reasoning generally that humans may have partial, inconsistent preferences, the AGI
attempts to extract their complete, consistent preferences on the basis of making them ﬁt the moral
fact of the Golden Rule. This results in a strictly worse outcome for Alice and Bob than if the AGI
had not attempted to align itself with their preferences on the assumption of this particular moral
fact given they live in a world without moral facts.
Moral anti-realism
If we suppose anti-realism, then we must build aligned AGI to reason about conﬂicts in human
values and to learn human values in the absence of any normative assumptions grounded in moral
facts. Now suppose this assumption is false and moral facts do exist, then our moral-facts-denying
AGI would resolve value conﬂicts and learn human values in a way not based on moral facts and
would fail to act in a way that fully satisﬁed human preferences. Such an AGI might still achieve de
facto alignment with human values if it adopted conﬂict resolution mechanisms and value learning
norms that were functionally equivalent to those it would have adopted if it had known moral facts,
and it may be able to do this because the unacknowledged moral facts would impact such an AGI
through their inﬂuence on human values. Although less efﬁcient than acting on moral facts directly,
this suggests an anti-realist AGI could still stand a chance of aligning itself based on moral facts
as revealed by the human values being aligned with in a world where moral facts exist and be less
likely to suffer from false positives than a realist AGI.
To make the argument clear, like in the previous section, let’s consider the case where we build an
AGI, although this time it is anti-realist and it exists in a world where moral facts actually exist.
Speciﬁcally, for the sake of argument, let’s suppose the Golden Rule is a moral fact in this world.
Not believing in moral facts, though, the AGI looks to other sources for norms to resolve value
conﬂicts and to extract human values from observations of behavior.
For example, Alice and Bob may have their preferences as in the previous example, and also a
shared preference for fairness. Supposing that Alice and Bob are the sum total of all humans in
this world, the AGI learns that all humans prefer fairness and so adopts it as a norm (assuming the
AGI has been programmed with a meta-norm of adopting those values that all humans express).
Enter into this situation a day when Alice would like to eat pie and Bob would like to eat cake.
5


## Page 6


The AGI can now act to assist or hinder Alice and Bob in one of two ways consistent with their
preference for fairness: either neither is allowed to eat cake or pie or both are allowed to eat cake
and pie.
If the AGI acts to prohibit eating either, it will coincidentally act in accord with the Golden Rule.
If the AGI acts to allow eating either, it will coincidentally violate the Golden Rule. In the former
case Alice and Bob will be, perhaps even unbeknownst to them, getting more of what they value
because it satisﬁes the moral fact of their world of the Golden Rule, and in the latter case will be
getting less of what they want, also possibly without their explicit knowledge. Unknown to the
AGI and possibly unknown to Alice and Bob, fairness is actually a proxy value for the Golden
Rule, but because the AGI adopts fairness as a norm rather than the Golden Rule directly it may,
on the margin in situations like the one described, act in ways contradictory to the Golden Rule,
thus rendering the anti-realist AGI less efﬁcient at satisfying human values than a realist AGI in
this world where moral facts exist.
Moral skepticism
If we suppose skepticism, then we must build aligned AGI in the absence of any knowledge of
moral facts, which is similar to the anti-realist case, but different in that there we assume moral
facts do not exist where here we remain open to the possibility that moral facts may exist even
if we don’t or can’t know them. Now suppose this assumption is false and we can know about
the existence of moral facts such that we could, even if only in theory, decide in favor of realism
or anti-realism, then the AGI may fail to acknowledge and use this knowledge to make more
informed decisions about value conﬂict resolution and to better learn human values, however we
could reasonably expect this to be mitigated because skepticism, unlike realism and anti-realism,
need not assume a strong metaphysical claim and only instead claim that perfect knowledge is
not possible, thus the skeptical AGI could switch to believing realism or anti-realism with high
credence and act on that belief. This still leaves open the practical question of how a skeptical AGI
would address value conﬂicts and choose norms for learning human values, but it could reasonably
either choose norms the same way an anti-realist AGI would until it learned more, or it could
adopt norm particularism to ground its norms on moral assumptions after the style of Dancy’s
ethical particularism despite not being able to make absolute truth claims about which norms are
best (Dancy, 1983). However it chooses norms, in having greater ﬂexibility of choice about moral
facts it mitigates the risk of false positives from the assumption it makes about their existence.
In this case our example will come in two parts. For both, let’s suppose we construct a morally
skeptical AGI in a world where either moral facts deﬁnitely exist or don’t. Again, we will speciﬁ-
cally consider the case of the moral fact of the Golden Rule existing or not.
If our skeptical AGI ﬁnds itself in the world where moral facts exist, it faces a similar situation
to the anti-realist AGI in the previous section. However, unlike the anti-realist AGI, because our
skeptical AGI has not decided against moral facts, it can provisionally adopt the belief that moral
facts do exist and search for them. Depending on the world it may or may not be able to discover
that the Golden Rule is a speciﬁc moral fact that holds in it, but regardless of this it can at least move
6


## Page 7


in the direction of more accurately acting in accordance with the world it ﬁnds itself in. It could
then, for example, move towards an adoption of norms that might seemingly violate the observed
preferences of Alice and Bob but would better satisfy their values given that it would include in this
world the moral fact of the Golden Rule. In practice this might look like ﬁrst adopting the fairness
norm the way the anti-realist AGI did, then learning more and updating to the Golden Rule and
applying it more strongly, thus eliminating the efﬁciency losses the anti-realist AGI suffered in the
realist world.
If our skeptical AGI ﬁnds itself in a world where moral facts do not exist, it’s in a similar but much
better situation than the realist AGI in the second previous section. Unlike the realist AGI, the
skeptical AGI need not assume knowledge of any speciﬁc moral fact, like the Golden Rule, or even
believe it can discover any moral facts, so it can instead look to discover norms from elsewhere.
Rather than adopting the Golden Rule, it might adopt a fairness norm assuming Alice and Bob
both express this preference and it could use this to resolve value conﬂicts between them and infer
values from their behavior. The adoption of this norm would remain contingent on observations,
though, and not be held as fact, so it would not risk acting against human values by thinking it
knew human values better than the human did by virtue of knowledge of non-existent moral facts.
Results
The result of this analysis is that it is best to build AGI assuming moral skepticism to reduce the
risk of false positives when building aligned AGI. Although it may be a much less direct route to
aligned AGI than assuming realism would be if realism were true and a slightly less direct route
than assuming anti-realism if anti-realism were true, skepticism allows AGI safety research to
avoid committing to a hinge proposition that will much raise the risk of false positives and avoids
unnecessarily hindering AGI efﬁciency at human value satisfaction.
It’s worthwhile to note that we don’t necessarily need to build AGI that are aligned to “true” values
or moral facts if they contradict human preferences. It is only necessary to deal with normative
uncertainty because of conﬂicts that arise in aggregating values and difﬁculties in inferring values
from observed behavior. Absent these concerns it would not matter what hinge propositions, if
any, were adopted concerning meta-ethical uncertainty. Similarly we only consider the realist/anti-
realist divide because it is a clear hinge on which all norm selection choices implicitly depend,
and analysis of other, more modern, complex, and nuanced ethical and moral positions may be
worthwhile if a choice about them must necessarily be made. Doing a similar analysis of other
hinge propositions necessitated by meta-ethical uncertainty is a potentially valuable direction for
future research, as is evaluating particular norms that might be adopted by an AGI in the same
way we are here evaluating hinge propositions to minimize the likelihood of false positives and
minimize existential risk.
Uncertainty about mental phenomena
Schemes to align AGI with human values depend on the dispositions of AGI, and one disposi-
tion AGI has is to subjective experience, consciousness, and mental phenomena (Adeofe, 1997),
7


## Page 8


(Nagel, 1974). Whether or not we expect AGI to realize this disposition matters because it in-
ﬂuences the types of alignment schemes that can be considered since an AGI without a mental
aspect can only be inﬂuenced by modifying its algorithms and manipulating its behavior whereas
an AGI with a mind (and for our purposes here, is “conscious”) can be inﬂuenced by engaging
with its perceptions and understanding of the world (Dreyfus, 1978). In other words we might
say mindless AGI can be aligned only by algorithmic and behavioral methods whereas conscious
AGI can also be aligned by “philosophical” methods that work on its epistemology, ontology, and
axiology (Brentano, 1995). It’s unclear what we should expect about the mentality of future AGI,
though, because we are presently uncertain about mental phenomena in general (cf. the work of
Chalmers and Searle for modern, popular, and opposing views on the topic), so we are forced to
speculate about mental phenomena in AGI when we reason about alignment (Chalmers, 1996),
(Searle, 1984).
Note, though, that this uncertainty may not be fundamental (Dennett, 1991). For example, if ma-
terialist or functionalist attempts to explain mental phenomena prove adequate, perhaps because
they lead to the development of conscious AGI, then we may agree on what mental phenomena are
and how they work (Oizumi et al., 2014). If they don’t, though, we’ll likely be left with metaphys-
ical uncertainty around mental phenomena that’s rooted in the epistemic limitations of perception
(Husserl, 2014). Regardless of how uncertainty about mental phenomena might later be resolved,
it currently creates a need for pragmatically making assumptions about it in our reasoning about
alignment. In particular we want to know whether or not we should design alignment schemes that
assume a mind, even if we expect mental phenomena to be reducible to other phenomena. Given
that we remain uncertain and cannot dismiss the possibility of conscious AGI, what we decide
depends on how likely alignment schemes are to succeed and to avoid false positives conditional
on AGI having the capacity for mental phenomena. The choice is then between whether we design
alignment schemes that work without reference to mind or whether they engage with it.
Initial false positive analysis
If we suppose AGI do not have minds, whether because we believe they have none, are inacces-
sible to us, or not causally relevant to alignment, then alignment schemes can only address the
algorithms and behavior of AGI. Such schemes include but are not limited to approaches that aim
to directly encode values in AGI or focus on inverse reinforcement learning to discover human
values (Hadﬁeld-Menell et al., 2016). Now suppose this assumption is false and AGI do have
minds, then our alignment schemes that work only on algorithms and behavior would be expected
to continue to work since they function without regard to the mental phenomena of AGI, making
the minds of AGI irrelevant to alignment. This suggests there is little risk of false positives from
supposing AGI do not have minds.
If we suppose AGI do have minds, then alignment schemes can also use philosophical methods to
address the values, goals, models, and behaviors of AGI. Such schemes would likely take the form
of ensuring that updates to an AGI’s ontology and axiology converge on and maintain alignment
with human interests (de Blanc, 2011), (Armstrong, 2015). Now suppose this assumption is false
and AGI do not have minds, then our alignment schemes that employ philosophical methods will
8


## Page 9


likely fail because they are attempting to address mechanisms of action not present in AGI. This
suggests there is a risk of false positives from supposing AGI have minds proportionate with the
likelihood that we do not build conscious AGI.
From this analysis it seems we should suppose mindless AGI when designing alignment schemes
so as to reduce the risk of false positives, but note that we did not consider the likelihood of success
at aligning AGI using only algorithmic and behavioral methods. That is, all else may not be equal
between these two assumptions such that the one with the lower risk of false positives might not
be the better choice if we have additional information that leads us to believe that alignment of
conscious AGI is much more likely to succeed than the alignment of mindless AGI, and it appears
that we have such information in the form of Goodhart’s curse.
Revised analysis in light of Goodhart’s curse
Goodhart’s curse says that when optimizing for the measure of a target value the optimization
process will implicitly maximize divergence of the measure from the target value (Yudkowsky,
2017a). This is an observation that follows from the combination of Goodhart’s law and the opti-
mizer’s curse.
As originally formulated, Goodhart’s law says “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to col-
lapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes” (Goodhart, 1984). A more accessible
expression of Goodhart’s law, though, would be that when a measure of success becomes the target,
it ceases to be a good measure (Strathern, 1997). A well known example of Goodhart’s law comes
from a program to exterminate rats in French-colonial Hanoi, Vietnam: the program paid a bounty
for rat tails on the assumption that a rat tail represented a dead rat, but rat catchers would instead
catch rats, cut off their tails, and release the rats so they could breed and produce new rats so their
tails could be turned in for more bounties (Vann, 2003). There was a similar case with bounties
for dead cobras in British-colonial India that intended to incentivize the reduction of cobra pop-
ulations that instead resulted in the creation of cobra farms (Siebert, 2001). Additional examples
abound: targeting easily-measured clicks rather than conversions in online advertising, optimizing
for proﬁts over company health in business, and unintentionally incentivizing publication count
over academic progress in academia (Shraga, 2014), (Jackall, 2009), (Nature Publishing Group,
2010).
The optimizer’s curse observes that when choosing among several possibilities, if we choose the
option that is expected to maximize value, we will be “disappointed” (realize less than the expected
value) more often than average (Harrison and March, 1984). This happens because optimization
acts as a source of bias in favor of overestimation, even if the estimated value of each option is
not biased itself (Smith and Winkler, 2006). For example, a company trying to pick a project to
invest in to earn the highest rate of return will consistently earn less return than predicted due to
the optimizer’s curse (Chen and Dyer, 2009). Similarly a person trying to pick the best vacation
will, on average, have a worse vacation than expected because the vacation that looks the best is
more likely than the other options to look that way due to overestimation. Further, the effect of
the optimizer’s curse is robust: mitigating it is theoretically possible but requires certainty about
9

probability distributions that is impossible to obtain in practice and even if an agent satisﬁces
(accepts the option with the least expected value that is greater than neutral) rather than optimizes
they will still suffer more disappointment than gratiﬁcation (Smith and Winkler, 2006), (Marks,
2008). Consequently, when combined with Goodhart’s law, the effect is that attempts to optimize,
however weakly, for a measure of success result in increased likelihood of failure to hit the desired
target—Goodhart’s curse.
This tendency of measure and target value to diverge under optimization is also known as “re-
gressional Goodharting” and is a special case of a more general phenomenon known simply as
“Goodharting” (Manheim and Garrabrant, 2018). We need not especially concern ourselves with
these more general cases, though, because Goodhart’s curse is enough to make us reconsider the
likelihood of successfully aligning AGI with human value by attempting to optimize their algo-
rithms and behaviors rather than engaging with their minds.
Suppose we have an alignment scheme that proposes to align an AGI with human values via hu-
mans manipulating its algorithm or the AGI observing human behavior to infer human values. In
the case of manipulating its algorithm, humans are preferentially choosing (viz. optimizing for)
changes that result in better expectation of alignment. In the case of the AGI observing human
behavior, it is trying to determine the best model of human values that explains the observed be-
havior. Both cases create conditions for alignment of the AGI to suffer from Goodhart’s curse and
therefore diverge from actual human values by optimizing for something other than human values
themselves, namely appearance of alignment as observed by humans and strength of model ﬁt as
measured by the AGI.
This argument implies that attempts to align mindless AGI via algorithmic and behavioral methods
will reliably result in AGI that diverge from human values and thus fail of align with human inter-
ests. This leads us to conclude that, although assuming conscious AGI has a greater risk of false
positives than assuming mindless AGI all else equal, all else is not equal, mindless AGI is unlikely
to be capable of maintaining alignment, and thus we are forced to take on the risks associated with
assuming conscious AGI when designing alignment schemes due to the low probability of success
from assuming otherwise.
Conclusion
As argued, since the development of AGI has a bimodal distribution of outcomes that causes us
to favor false negatives to false positives to better avoid catastrophe, we are best off if we choose
epistemically necessary hinge propositions (assumptions) that minimize false positives all else
equal. We considered two such cases where assumptions are necessary.
In the ﬁrst case, because AGI alignment requires making assumptions about norms over human val-
ues, alignment necessitates resolving questions of meta-ethical uncertainty which means, in part,
choosing an assumption about the existence of moral facts. We evaluated the possible assumptions
of moral realism, anti-realism, and skepticism, and found realism to have the highest risk of false
10

positives and skepticism to have the least. For that reason we recommend AGI safety researchers
assume and design AGI to assume moral skepticism.
In the second case, because AGI alignment schemes may depend or not on AGI having minds, we
considered the hinge proposition that AGI will be conscious. Although it turned out that, in terms
of risk of false positives, it was safer to assume AGI will be mindless when designing an alignment
scheme, because of Goodhart’s curse it is substantially unlikely that alignment of mindless AGI is
possible. Consequently we recommend AGI researchers to design alignment schemes that assume
conscious AGI.
These are not necessarily all the assumptions that must be made in the construction of AGI aligned
with human values, but they are at least two that must be, and additional evidence and arguments
may lead us to conclude that a different bundle of assumptions are better responses to the philo-
sophical and practical points of uncertainty that forced us to make assumptions. Future research
should consider additional points of uncertainty that demand we make assumptions about AGI
alignment to better understand the distribution of alignment schemes that are likely to result in
acceptable outcomes for humanity.
