Abstract 
Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved problem of 
structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and 
Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate 
protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known 
PDZ-2  protein,  and  confirmed  that  this  protein  has  two  cognate  allosteric 
pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property 
was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through 
the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a 
normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 Å) that acted as a thermal rectifier.  In 
contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60 
Å), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat diffusion was 
due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of residues that, in 
turn,  was also mediated  by hydrogen bonds. This asymmetrical/symmetrical 
energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal communication directionality in 
proteins and for the control of heat flow in materials science.

Introduction
Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved 
problem  in  structural  biochemistry.  This  phenomenon  is  involved  in  crucial 
cellular and physiological functions and is determinant in human diseases.1-3 
Allosteric communication can mediate signal transmission through proteins on 
both short (3 Å) and long (100 Å) range scales, and is studied using both 
experimental4-12  and theoretical  8,13-19 techniques, and its occurrence has been 
clearly established. 
Several questions surround the phenomenology of signal transduction and 
energy flow in proteins. This paper assesses how energy is transported from one 
site to another in proteins. In particular, directionality for energy flow in proteins 
was empirically observed. The structure underlying this directional energy flow 
was the normal length hydrogen bond  (~2.85 Å). This result suggests that a 
normal length hydrogen bond is the minimal chemical structure that can operate 
as a thermal rectifier in  biomolecules. Another source of asymmetrical heat 
diffusion was found on a higher scale in the local structural organization of 
residues, which were also mediated by hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the thermal 
rectification effect seemed to be suppressed in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60 Å), 
giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical energy flow may be 
relevant for allosteric signal communication directionality in protein structures 
and for heat flow control in the field of materials science. 
Hydrogen  bonds  have  been  an  inexhaustible  source  of  research  for 
decades.20 Their role as stabilizing agents in protein structures has been clearly 
established.21 They also act in the modulation of chemical reactivity in proteins 22-
24 and,  as  has  been  proposed  earlier  in  the  field  of  physics,  can  act  as  a 
supporting structure for vibrational energy flow in protein structures.25 Recent 
studies have shown that hydrogen bonds are also important in heat diffusion 
across the β-sheet structure of the spider silk protein26 and in α-helices.27
Due to their polymeric nature, when proteins fold to reach their biologically

active state they generate a complex network of contacts. Previous reports have 
shown  that  thermal  energy  flows  in  proteins  according  to  the  physical 
connectivity of this network28, with velocities of propagation on the order of 10 Å 
ps-1.14 This flow of thermal  energy mimics  the heat transport of percolation 
clusters, where the energy flows anisotropically, that is, faster along physically 
connected channels and slower along the numerous pathways that reach dead-
ends.14 The anisotropic heat flow in proteins was empirically demonstrated by 
Ota and Agard using a computational pump-probe method termed Anisotropic 
Thermal  Diffusion  (ATD).30 Anisotropic  thermal  diffusion  is  a  non-equilibrium 
molecular dynamics (MD) pump-probe method that has been used to study 
allosteric communication pathways in proteins.15,29-30 Various studies support a 
direct correlation between  the heat diffusion pathways in proteins and their 
known allosteric communication pathways.15,29-30 In its original formulation,30 the 
protein  model  is  equilibrated  in  the  absence  of  a  solvent  at  a  very  low 
temperature  to  minimize  background  noise.  After  this,  a  specific  residue  is 
heated by coupling it to a thermal bath (pump), and the increase in vibrational 
energy is measured in different sites of the protein (probe) over a short time 
lapse. The correlations between anisotropic vibrational energy propagation and 
the  cognate  structural  allosteric  pathways  have  been  confirmed  in  other 
systems,31 supporting  the  utility  of  ATD  for  the  characterization  and 
comprehension of these mechanisms.
 
In the simplest cases, allosteric communication involves a protein, a ligand 
site, and an effector site in the same protein. After ligand binding, a signal is 
propagated throughout the protein structure to the effector site. Depending on 
the response of the signal on the effector site, allosteric modulation may be 
positive or negative.32 As an example of positive modulation, the binding of 
vancomicin  to  the  glycopeptide  antibiotic  facilitates  the  dimerization  of  two 
molecules of the antibiotic.33 On the other hand, negative modulation is observed 
when cAMP molecules bind to the catabolite activator protein (CAP). Here, the 
binding of the first cAMP molecule makes the binding of the second cAMP to CAP 
more difficult.10

Thermodynamically, the free energy of allosteric processes in proteins has 
been interpreted by attributing the enthalpic part to conformational changes in 
the protein structure and the entropic contribution to the dynamical fluctuations 
of residues.7,34-35 Based on this distinction, three types of allosteric signaling are 
distinguished: Type I, with small or subtle conformational changes, governed 
largely  by  entropy  (ΔH≈0); Type  II,  with  the  participation  of enthalpic  and 
entropic components to different extents; and Type III, largely governed by 
enthalpic  changes  (ΔS≈0).34 Type  I  allosteric  communication  has  been  less 
studied as compared to the enthalpic communication of Types II and III. 5-6 Type 
I allosterism, also known as dynamic or configurational allosterism, was initially 
proposed by Cooper and Dryden35 in 1984. According to these authors, Type I 
allosterism  arises  from  changes  in  the  frequencies  and  amplitudes  of 
macromolecular fluctuations around the same protein conformation and involves 
several forms of dynamic behavior, ranging from highly correlated low-frequency 
normal-mode  vibrations  to  random  local  anharmonic  motions  of  individual 
groups or atoms. These fluctuations can be described in terms of vibration, 
libration, or rotation of individual groups that propagate vibrational energy along 
the protein structure.35 Systems such as staphylococcal nuclease,36  myoglobin,37 
serine proteases,38 HIV-1 protease,39 dihydrofolate reductase,40 β−lactamase,41 
and  the  Post–synaptic  density-95/Drosophila  disc/Zonula  occludens-1  (PDZ) 
domain  protein  family7,16,30 are  known  to  transfer  allosteric  information  by 
altering  their  dynamics  without  significant  conformational  changes  (Type  I 
allosterism).
The allosteric pathways of the PDZ domain family are also interesting as 
they involve residues which are distant in terms of protein structure. The PDZ 
protein  family  has  a  common  structural  domain  of  80-96  amino-acids,  and 
appears in signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses,42 and animals.43 
Experimental,7 statistical  coupling  analysis  (SCA),16  and  theoretical  models44 
have  been  used  to  characterize  this  protein  family,  and  a  consensus  of  its 
allosteric  pathways  has  been  reached.  In  particular,  using  cross-correlation 
analysis, Kong and Karplus19 report two pathways of allosteric communication for

PDZ-2. In Pathway I (Figure 1), the allosteric communication pathway goes from 
strand  β2
 (residues 19-24)  and  extends  along  the  long  axis  of  the  helix  α1 
(residues 44-49), and Pathway II starts at strand β2
 and goes across strands β3 
(residues 33-40), β4  (residues 56-61), and β6  (residues 83-90) to β1(residues 6-
13).  A  structural  interpretation  for  the  correlations  obtained  by  SCA16 was 
initially obtained using ATD.30 The pathways of energetic connectivity observed 
with  ATD  were  consistent  with  the  correlations  between  residues  found  by 
SCA.16,30 
As ATD is a quick method, it can be extended to the automatic mapping of 
heat propagation from every residue in a protein structure.31 In this numerical 
study, a review of the heat propagation pathways of the PDZ-2 protein was 
comprehensively  performed,  and  full  heat  propagation  maps  of  energetic 
connectivity were obtained. Confirmation that vibrational energy flows through 
the connectivity network via previously reported19 allosteric pathways is offered, 
but it is also shown that these paths of energetic connectivity were not found to 
be  completely  symmetric.  The  observations  suggest  that  normal  length 
hydrogen bonds can act as thermal rectifiers for heat diffusion and that this 
rectifying  capability  can  be  modulated  by  bond  length.  The  study  and 
understanding  of  heat  flow  directionality   –  phonon  rectification –  is  highly 
desirable in the field of materials science for the development of thermal gates,45 
thermal  memories,46 and  acoustic  cloakers.47 In  this  respect,  the  structural 
inclusion of the rich dynamics of hydrogen bonds in the designs of materials 
science may be a useful alternative for implementing these thermal devices.
Methods and Computational Details.
The PDZ-2 protein in the presence of the ligand,19 herein termed PDZ-2·L 
(PDB ID: 1D5G), and without the ligand, herein termed PDZ-2 (PDB ID: 3PDZ), 
were used for simulations. These models were minimized and equilibrated using 
periodic boundary conditions at 298 K and 1 atm with water as an explicit 
solvent and NaCl at 0.15 M. Constant temperature conditions were used through


## Page 7


Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient of 5 ps-1. An integration time-step 
of 2 fs and a cutoff of non-bonded forces at 12 Å with a switching function 
starting at 10 Å were used. Equilibration was divided into three steps. First, the 
coordinates of the protein models were fixed to allow the solvent and ions to 
equilibrate  for  200  ps.  Second,  the  coordinates  of  the  lateral  chains  were 
released and equilibrated for another 200 ps. Third, all atoms were released and 
allowed to equilibrate for 2 ns. Finally, a production run of 20 ns was performed, 
after which 20 equally spaced frames were selected for the ATD procedure. For 
each of the 20 frames, the solvent was removed and the protein model was 
cooled to 10 K for 100 ps MD. At this point, the ATD procedure was applied using 
a set of automated  scripts31 available at https://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/atd-
scripts  and  by  adding  the  option  rigidbonds=none.  The  scripts  allowed  the 
automated,  individual  heating  of each residue  of the  protein,  in addition to 
permitting temperature analysis of every other residue after a short predefined 
time-lapse of 30 ps. Each residue was individually coupled to a thermal bath at 
300 K, and the thermal response in the rest of the protein was measured. A 
total of 20 independent ATD scans were performed for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L. The 
results were averaged and used to construct the contact and thermal diffusion 
maps shown in Figure 2. All simulations were performed using the NAMD2.9 
software48 with the CHARMM2249 potential and CMAP correction50. Visualization 
and data analysis were performed using the VMD 1.8.7 software.51
Results.
Figures 1 (a) and (b) show the structures of PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L.  Figures 2 
(a)  and  (b)  show  the  contact  and  thermal  diffusion  maps  averaged  for  20 
independent simulations for both cases. The thermal diffusion maps showed a 
rough  similarity  with  the  connectivity  maps.  These  plots  showed  that  heat 
diffused mainly through structure connectivity. These contacts belonged to the 
covalent  network  of  the  primary  structure  or  arose  from  the  side-chain 
interactions of residues in different elements of the secondary structure of the

models. The thermal maps revealed that the allocation of allosteric Pathways I 
and II for both models can be recovered using ATD, and both pathways can be 
deduced by inspecting the averaged thermal maps. A close inspection of Figure 2 
uncovered  how Pathway  II was recovered. By looking at the abscissa of the 
thermal map for PDZ-2 at β2, a thermal coupling to β3 was observed (Box 1). Next, 
looking at the thermal map for the abscissa at β3, a vibrational coupling with β4 
was seen (Box 2). Then, entering the thermal map for the abscissa at  β4, a 
vibrational coupling with β6 appeared (Box 3). Finally, by entering the abscissa at 
β6, a strong vibrational coupling to β1 was noted (Box 4). Now, in order to recover 
Pathway I, the PDZ-2·L thermal map was analyzed. By entering in the abscissa at 
β2, a vibrational coupling with α1 occurred (encircled area). In the case of PDZ-2 a 
strong coupling among β2 and α1 was not found. Thus, the presence of the ligand 
enhanced this pathway. This can be clearly observed by comparing both thermal 
maps. With this inspection, Pathways I and II19 were reproduced.
Vibrational couplings in other regions were affected by the presence of the 
ligand. The thermal map of PDZ-2 at abscissa in β3 displayed a strong vibrational 
coupling to residues 66-69 (a region between β5 and α2) and to residue 90 of β6. 
Both  these  thermal  coupling  were  quenched  in  the  presence  of  the  ligand. 
Therefore, heat propagation was once again found modulated by the presence of 
the ligand. This modulation resulted from observable structural rearrangements, 
but these were not evident from the contact maps alone. The similarity between 
contact maps and thermal maps suggests that communication pathways in Type I 
allosteric systems are primarily defined by atomic connectivity and its respective 
interaction.  In  this  particular  system  (PDZ-2),  connectivity  occurred  among 
secondary structure elements of the protein. 
The structural features that gave rise to the selected energetic couplings 
were analyzed in detail. For example, the thermal maps in Figure 2 displayed a 
thermal coupling between  β2
 and His71, corresponding to  α2  (highlighted with a 
triangle in the thermal maps). In the ligand-free PDZ-2 model (Figure 3a), this 
coupling arose from alternating hydrogen bonds between Nδ1 of His71 with Oγ1 
or with the oxygen atom of the C=O backbone moiety of Thr23 (Figure 3c, top).


## Page 9


This coupling also occurred from hydrogen bonds between Nδ1 of His71 with Oγ1 
or with  the oxygen  atom  of the C=O backbone moiety of Thr23 (Figure 3c, 
bottom). This effect was also observed in the thermal map of PDZ-2·L (Figure 
3b). In this case, the heat transference between  β2
 and  α2  was also due to the 
formation of hydrogen bonds, but it occurred between Nδ1 of His71 and the 
oxygen atom of the C=O backbone moiety of Gly24 (Figure 3d, top) or between 
Nε2 of His71 and Oγ1 of Thr23 (Figure 3d, bottom). These observations were 
consistent with recent reports about the role of hydrogen bonds in heat diffusion 
in protein structures.26,27 
Further observation of the results presented in Figure 2 revealed interesting 
features of heat propagation. Asymmetries were observed in the thermal diffusion 
maps. This was qualitatively observed using the color scale of the thermal maps 
in Figure 2. For instance, in Pathway II the heat interchange between β6 and  β1 
was asymmetrical (observed  in both PDZ-2 and  PDZ-2·L).  Likewise,  the heat 
interchange in Pathway I between β2 and α1 was also asymmetrical (observed in 
PDZ-2·L). It is quite possible that there is a preferential directionality in both 
cases. These asymmetries were observed at other points on the averaged thermal 
maps  and  supported the idea of signal propagation directionality in allosteric 
pathways. These asymmetries were rationalized by analyzing structure, pump-
probe plots, and energy flow, as shown in the following cases. 
Now,  the  asymmetrical  interaction  between  Asp5  and  Lys91,  which  are 
located in β6 and β1 respectively, of the PDZ-2 case will be presented. These two 
residues  interacted  through  a  backbone  hydrogen  bond  (Figure  4a).  A  clear 
asymmetrical pump-probe relationship was observed in Figure 4b (circles), in 
which heat was transferred with a preferential directionality going from Lys91 
towards Asp5. In the 20 propagations (see Methods section), 63% of time these 
residues  interacted  through  one backbone hydrogen  bond;  4.5% of the time 
residues interacted between hydrogen bonds formed by the lateral chains, and 
36.5% of the time no interaction was observed (distances greater than 3.5 Å). 
The pump-probe profile with standard deviation (Figure 4c) revealed a response 
at Asp5 of 98.4 ± 15.9 K when the pump was applied to Lys91, and a response at


## Page 10


Lys91 of 72.5 ± 12.3 when the pump was applied to Asp5. These data, in addition 
to the structural inspection of the hydrogen bond interaction, suggest that the 
preferential directionality of the heat flow (Lys91 
 Asp5) is due to the spatial
→
 
orientation of the hydrogen bond, that, in this case, has the configuration Lys91-
N-H···O=C-Asp5 (Figure 4a, right). To evaluate the possible relationship between 
heat flow directionality and orientation of the hydrogen bond, the kinetic energy 
in time of the atoms involved was determined and shown for three heat diffusion 
trajectories (Figures 4d, 4e, and 4f). As can be observed in Figure 4d, when the 
pump was applied to Lys91 a kinetic energy of ~1000 J/mol was observed  at 
10000 fs for the oxygen atom of the C=O moiety of Asp5 (Figure 4d, left). 
Inversely, when the pump was applied to Asp5 a kinetic energy of ~750 J/mol at 
10000 fs was observed for the nitrogen atom of the N-H moiety of Lys91 (Figure 
4d, right). The same observations held in Figures 4e and 4f, in which the C=O 
moiety  consistently reported increased kinetic energy along the propagations. 
These results imply that in this particular configuration of the hydrogen bond, 
heat diffuses easily in the direction N-H 
 O=C, and with difficultly in the inverse
→
 
direction, N-H 
 C=O. The origin of this effect may be due to the structural
←
 
asymmetry  of  the  hydrogen-bond  and  to  the  consequent  stretching  force 
constants associated with the N-H and C=O bonds (Figure 4a, left). For N-H and 
C=O, the stretching force constants were 440 and 620 kcal·mol-1·Å-2, respectively. 
Each moiety also had a particular partial charge state that was linked to the force 
field  and  the  associated  vibrations,  which  may  give  rise  to  the  observed 
phenomenology. Further analysis is required to give an exact explanation of the 
effect, which is beyond the scope of this article. Based on the observations for 
this specific case, it appears that the normal hydrogen bond acts as a thermal 
rectifier, that is, it can act as a molecular motif that transfers thermal energy with 
preferential directionality. This phenomenon is not new and has been observed in 
hydrogen-bond  enhanced  thermal  energy  transport  in  functionalized, 
hydrophobic, and hydrophilic silica−water interfaces.52 Nevertheless, the present 
report is, to the author's knowledge, the first to demonstrate this phenomenon in 
protein structures. In the case of PDZ-2·L, a similar phenomenon was observed


## Page 11


when  analyzing  the  interaction  between  Asp5-Lys9,  but  due  to  the  higher 
percentage  of  interaction  through  lateral  chains  for  the  PDZ-2·L,  subsequent 
discussion is, at this point, restricted only to PDZ-2.  
In the case of symmetrical heat diffusion, attention was directed to the 
structural  arrangement  of  Glu10-His86-Glu8  in  PDZ-2.  This  arrangement 
interacted  through  two  hydrogen  bonds  (Figure  5a).  In  this  specific  case, 
hydrogen bonds were intermittently formed between the available proton donors 
located at His86 (atoms Nδ1 and Nε2) and the respective proton acceptors (Atoms 
Oε1 and Oε2) located at carboxilyc moieties of the Glu10 and Glu8 residues. In 
the 20 propagations, >95% presented these interactions. A symmetrical pump-
probe relation was observed in the interaction of Glu10-His86 and His86-Glu8 for 
PDZ-2 (Figure 5b, rectangle). The pump-probe plots showed responses at Glu8 
and Glu10 of 114.3 ± 11.7 and 120.6 ± 8.6 K, respectively, when His86 was 
excited (Figure 5c, left). Inversely, a response at His86 of 120.0 ± 12.6 K was 
observed when Glu10 was excited (Figure 5c, right). Finally, a response at His86 
of 115.4 ± 7.2 K was observed when Glu8 was excited (plot not shown). These 
measurements reinforce the idea of an asymmetrical pump-probe relationship. 
Evaluations  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  hydrogen  bonds  for  the  interaction 
between Glu10 and HIS86 in three selected trajectories are shown Figures 5d, 5e, 
and 5f. On one hand, when the pump was applied to Glu10 a kinetic energy of 
~1500 J/mol at 10000 fs was observed for the nitrogen atom of the N-H moiety 
of His86 (Figures 5d, 5e, and 5f, left). These measurements showed a higher 
value when compared to the kinetic energy analysis when Asp 5 was excited, in 
which a response of ~750 J/mol at 10000 fs for the nitrogen atom of the N-H 
moiety of Lys91 was found (Figures 4d, 4e, and 4f, left). On the other hand, when 
His86 was excited, similar kinetic patterns were observed with respect to the heat 
injection  to  Glu10.  Comparison of the kinetic  energy plots  with the  previous 
Lys91-Asp5 case supports the idea of a symmetric response of the Glu10-His86 
arrangement. The main difference in both cases is that the former formed a 
charge-assisted hydrogen bond with an average length of ~2.62 Å (Figure 5, see 
insets in kinetic energy analysis), while the latter formed a normal non-charged


## Page 12


hydrogen bond with an average length of ~2.82 Å (Figure 4, see insets in kinetic 
energy analysis). An enhanced chemical reactivity of structural elements that 
surround hydrogen bonds that can suffer transition from normal bonding (> 2.8 
Å) to a short bonding regime (< 2.6  Å) has been previously reported.23 In line 
with this, the results of this report suggest that heat diffusivity behavior, whether 
symmetric or asymmetric, may be modulated by the length of the hydrogen 
bond.
The asymmetrical pump-probe relationship between the residues His32 and 
Glu90 was also analyzed for the ligand-free PDZ-2 model. These residues belong 
to Pathway II. As shown in Figure 6a, these residues were located in the loop 
connecting  β2-β3  and  at  the  end  of  the  β6  strand.  A  detailed  representative 
snapshot of the residues that were in contact with His32 and Glu90 is depicted in 
Figure 6b. As can be observed in the detail of the thermal map (Figure 6c), a 
preferential directionality of heat flow existed, in which the heating of Glu90 had 
an increased pump to His32. The pump-probe plots of His32 and Glu90 (Figures 
6c  and  6d) revealed  an  effective asymmetric relationship  between these two 
residues. While the heating of Glu90 raised the local temperature of His32 up to 
92.7±17.2 K,  the heating  of His32  raised  the local temperature  of Glu90  to 
74.5±17.7 K. Analysis of Figure 6b directly explained the results of Figure 6d. 
When the pump was applied at Glu90, heat mainly diffused to Arg57, His32, and 
Asp5. On the other hand, when the pump was applied at His32, heat diffused to 
Arg57 and Glu90. Given that His32 had contact with Glu67 at two alternating or 
simultaneous points (Figure 6b), increased quantities of vibrational energy were 
transferred to His32, thus quenching the transference to Glu90. Here Glu67 was 
the most important heat sink, giving rise to the asymmetrical behavior. Charge-
assisted hydrogen bonds were formed between Glu90, Arg57, and His32, while 
His32 formed a charge-assisted hydrogen bond with Glu67. It seems that the 
counter balance of the contacts gave rise to the observed behavior in this case. 
Another example of heat transfer directionality was observed in Pathway I. 
This pathway was observed in PDZ-2 and was enhanced in the case of PDZ-2·L 
(Figure 2, encircled area). This involved the group of residues Lys13, Asn14,


## Page 13


Asp15, Asn16, and Ser17 located in the loop connecting β2-β6, as well as Gln43 
located in the loop connecting β3-α1  (Figure 7a). A particular feature of group 13-
17 was the formation of a hydrogen bond cluster which formed a loop in this 
region (Figure 7b). It seems that this cluster readily exchanged heat within itsel, 
through the hydrogen bond cluster, and it then transferred thermal energy to 
Gln43. On the other hand, Gln43 was only able to transfer back to Asp15, as can 
be observed in the thermal map detail in Figure 7c. In this case, the source of 
asymmetric heat diffusion was given by the local three-dimensional organization 
of the residues that formed a funnel-like structure pointing towards Gln43, thus 
facilitating  heat  transfer  to  it,  naturally  impeding  the  inverse  process.  For 
completeness, the statistical pump-probe behavior is shown in Figure 7d. 
In summary, the results showed that it is possible to recover Pathways I 
and II using ATD. These observations suggest an important role of normal length 
hydrogen bonds in the directionality of vibrational energy transfer in proteins. 
Moreover,  the  topological  organization  of  residue  contacts  is  proposed  as  an 
important source of directional energy transfer in biomolecules.
Discussion and Conclusions.
Signal  transduction  in  proteins  is  an  important  problem  in  structural 
biochemistry.1-19 The aim of this work was to test one methodology, ATD30, in 
order to identify  pathways of energy propagation in the PDZ domain and to 
correlate them with the cognate I and II allosteric pathways for PDZ-2. This 
protein transfers allosteric signals with minor conformational changes7,9,12,19,53 and 
has been cataloged as a Type I entropic allosteric system.34 This type of allosteric 
communication  is  manifested  through  alterations  in  the  frequencies  and 
amplitudes  of  residue  fluctuations  and  involves  several  forms  of  dynamic 
behavior,  from  highly  correlated,  low-frequency  normal-mode  vibrations  to 
random local anharmonic motions of individual groups or atoms.33,35 Evidence 
from  experimental  studies,7  SCA,16 and  theoretical  analysis19,44 supports  the 
existence of two allosteric pathways for PDZ-2. In Pathway I (Figure 1), allosteric


## Page 14


communication went from strand β2
 and extended along the long axis of the helix 
α1. Pathway II started at strand β2
 and went across strands β3, β4, and β6 to β1. 
The results demonstrate that PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L have similar contact maps 
that resemble the thermal diffusion maps. This study concludes that a correlation 
exists between the flow of vibrational energy, the cognate I and II allosteric 
pathways for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L, and their respective contact maps. Thus, the 
connectivity between secondary elements of the protein structure appears to be 
the determining factor in Type I allosteric communication. The presence of a 
ligand can induce changes in the contacts between secondary elements so that 
the ligand can act as a thermal switch for the vibrational coupling of the allosteric 
pathways.
The results also show that hydrogen bonds are implicated in the heat flow 
among different segments of the protein, as was found in the coupling between β2 
and α2. In this case, hydrogen bonds were formed between His71 and Thr23 for 
PDZ-2, and between His71 and Thr26 or between His71 and the C=O backbone 
moiety  of Gly24 for PDZ-2·L. The role of hydrogen bonds in enhancing  heat 
diffusion  has  been  demonstrated  in  models  of  α-helices,27 in  which  a  higher 
number of hydrogen  bonds produces higher thermalization rates. The role of 
hydrogen bonds in heat diffusion has also been shown in spider silk.26  Thus, the 
observations of the present study are consistent with and supported by these 
previous reports. 
The main result of this research was the detection of preferential heat flow 
directionality along allosteric pathways. This directionality was observed through 
the details provided by the thermal maps for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L. Directionality 
occurred in the absence of a ligand and could be modulated by its presence. This 
phenomenon  was  studied  at  points  of  PDZ-2  and  was  consistent  with  the 
expected  behavior  of  an  allosteric  protein,  that  is,  to  transfer  signals  with 
preferential  directionality.  The  smallest  organizational  unit  that  presents  this 
property is the hydrogen bond. A punctual analysis of the interaction between 
Asp5 and Lys91 suggested that normal length hydrogen bonds behave as thermal 
rectifiers,  which  is  to  say,  they  transfers  vibrational  energy  with  preferential


## Page 15


directionality.  This  effect  may  originate  from  the  natural  asymmetry  of  the 
hydrogen bond given by the N-H and C=O moieties. Also, because N-H is a single 
bond and C=O is a double bond, the amplitude of the stretching that each moiety 
reaches during similar thermal excitation is higher for the latter and lower for the 
former. Further research is required to reveal the mechanism of the asymmetrical 
heat diffusion in this particular structure. The role of hydrogen bonds as thermal 
diodes  has  been  previously  proposed  in  MD  simulations  of  asymmetrical 
functionalized silica slabs floating in water.52 In these simulations, one side of the 
silica is hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. Heat flow is favored when applied 
in the hydrophobic to hydrophilic direction and impeded in the inverse direction. 
On a smaller scale, this research shows that the heat flow is favored in the 
direction of N-H 
 O=C and impeded in the inverse direction. This behavior is
→
 
compromised in the case of short hydrogen bonds, as was observed in the pump-
probe analysis of the interaction of Glu10-His86. As Glu and His have -1 and +1 
charges, respectively, both assisted the formation of short hydrogen bonds, ~2.6 
Å. This was the main difference in regards to the interaction between Asp5-Lys91, 
which presented a normal hydrogen bond of length of ~2.85 Å. It seems that the 
short  distances  between  the  N-H  and  the  C=O  moieties  observed  for  the 
interaction between Glu10-His86 impeded the asymmetric behavior of thermal 
diffusion. Quantum mechanical models have previously shown that the transition 
between  a normal  and short bonding regime significantly alters  the chemical 
reactivity of the structural elements that surround a given hydrogen bond.23 The 
present study, using classical MD, suggests that the transition from a normal to a 
short hydrogen bond regime may modulate the thermal diode effect.
 Asymmetrical  heat  transference  was  also  observed  in  the  complex 
interaction  of  residues,  as  depicted  in  Figures  6  and  7.  In  the  case  of  the 
asymmetrical pump-probe relationship between Glu90-His32, a set of hydrogen-
bonded interacting residues explains the observed directionality. For example, 
when heat was provided to Glu90, it was directly transferred to His32, Arg57, and 
to Asp5, whereas the structural organization surrounding His32, namely, Gly33 
and Glu67, quenched the heat transfer to Glu90. As shown in the pump-probe


## Page 16


plot of His32, Glu67 acted as a thermal sink that trapped an important quantity of 
heat. So, the topological organization of a set of interacting residues may be the 
reason for asymmetrical heat diffusion behavior. A similar phenomenology seems 
to  be  operative  in  the  interaction  of  residues  13-17  and  Gln43  (Figure  7). 
Observation of the structure at this segment revealed a hydrogen bond network 
organization similar to a funnel pointing towards residue Gln43. As residues 13- 
17 were heated, they distributed heat among each other and transferred it to 
Gln43, while the heating of Gln43 mainly transferred  back to residue Asp15. This 
residue  was  the individual  heat connection of group  13-17 to  Gln43.  All the 
previous data suggest an important role of hydrogen bonds in vibrational coupling 
among segments of the secondary structure in this system and, therefore, in the 
constitution of allosteric pathways. 
In summary, this work analyzed the vibrational energy diffusion in PDZ-2 
and the correlation with cognate allosteric pathways for this system. Examples of 
asymmetrical  heat  propagation  in  protein  structures  that  give  rise  to  signal 
directionality were also offered. Thermal diffusion maps showed a high degree of 
similarity with connectivity maps, thus supporting the idea that Type I allosteric 
communication is the connectivity network that defines the allosteric route and its 
directionality.  Taken  together,  it  is  suggested  that  hydrogen  bonds  play  an 
important role as a transport structure for heat and thermal rectification in the 
allosteric communication pathways of proteins.
