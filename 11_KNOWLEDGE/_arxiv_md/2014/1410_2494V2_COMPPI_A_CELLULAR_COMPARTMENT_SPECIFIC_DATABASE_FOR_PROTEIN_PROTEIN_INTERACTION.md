ABSTRACT 
Here we present ComPPI, a cellular compartment- 
specific database of proteins and their interactions 
enabling an extensive, compartmentalized protein– 
protein interaction network analysis (URL: http:// 
ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu). ComPPI enables the user 
to filter biologically unlikely interactions, where the 
two interacting proteins have no common subcel- 
lular localizations and to predict novel properties, 
such as compartment-specific biological functions. 
ComPPI is an integrated database covering four 
species (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster 
and H. sapiens). The compilation of nine protein– 
protein interaction and eight subcellular localization 
data sets had four curation steps including a man- 
ually built, comprehensive hierarchical structure of 
>1600 subcellular localizations. ComPPI provides 
confidence scores for protein subcellular localiza- 
tions and protein–protein interactions. ComPPI has 
user-friendly search options for individual proteins 
giving their subcellular localization, their interac- 
tions and the likelihood of their interactions consid- 
ering the subcellular localization of their interacting 
partners. Download options of search results, whole- 
proteomes, organelle-specific interactomes and sub- 
cellular localization data are available on its website. 
Due to its novel features, ComPPI is useful for the 
analysis of experimental results in biochemistry and 
molecular biology, as well as for proteome-wide stud- 
ies in bioinformatics and network science helping 
cellular biology, medicine and drug design. 
INTRODUCTION 
Biological processes are separated in the cellular and sub- 
cellular space, which helps their precise regulation. Com- 
partmentalization of signalling pathways is a key regulator 
of several main biochemical processes, such as the nuclear 
translocation-mediated activation of transcription factors 
(1). Several proteins are located in more than one subcel- 
lular localizations. As an example, IGFBP-2 is a predomi- 
nantly extracellular protein with a key role in insulin growth 
factor signalling (2), while its translocation into the nucleus 
results in vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated an- 
giogenesis (3). Another important example is the HIF-1 
Alpha with translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, 
where it acts as a transcription factor involved in the main- 
tenance of cellular oxygen homeostasis (4) (Supplementary 
Figure S1). Their shuttling between these localizations is 
a key regulatory mechanism, which implicates the impor- 
tance of improving the systems level analysis of compart- 
mentalized biological processes. 
Protein–protein interaction data are one of the most valu- 
able sources for proteome-wide analysis (5), especially to 
understand human diseases on the systems-level (6) and 
to help network-related drug design (7). However, protein– 
protein interaction databases often contain data with low 
overlap (8), and are designed using different protocols (9), 
therefore, their integration is needed to improve our com- 
prehensive knowledge (10). Low-throughput data sets of- 
ten use several different protein naming conventions caus- 
ing difficulties in data analysis and integration. Manual cu- 
ration of data yields a large improvement of data quality 
(11). 
Interaction data  often contain interactions,  where the 
two interacting proteins have no common subcellular lo- 
calizations (12). These interactions could be biophysically 
possible, but biologically unlikely (13). Thus, these interac- 
tions cause data bias that leads to deteriorated reliability 
in interactome-based studies (14), especially those involv-

ing subcellular localization-specific cellular processes (15). 
Unfortunately, subcellular localization data are incomplete. 
Despite the need of experimentally verified subcellular lo- 
calizations for reliable compartmentalization-based inter- 
actome filtering (16), only computationally predicted sub- 
cellular localization information is available for a large part 
of the proteome. Moreover, subcellular localization data are 
redundant, often poorly structured and miss to highlight 
the reliability of data (17). 
Existing analysis tools involving subcellular localizations 
offer the download of filtered interactomes for a subset of 
proteins (like MatrixDB (18)). Several databases use only 
Gene Ontology (GO (19)) cellular component terms as the 
source of the subcellular localization data (such as HitPre- 
dict (20) or Cytoscape BiNGO plugin (21)), while GO still 
contains data inconsistency despite its highly structured an- 
notations (22). Cytoscape Cerebral plugin (23) generates a 
view of the interactome separated into layers according to 
their subcellular localization. In different data sets the sub- 
cellular localization structure is not uniform, which makes 
their comparisons often difficult. 
ComPPI-based interactomes introduced here provide a 
broader coverage (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), us- 
ing several curation steps in data integration. ComPPI of- 
fers highly structured subcellular localization data sup- 
plemented with Localization and Interaction confidence 
Scores, all presented with user-friendly options. As a key 
feature ComPPI allows the construction of high-confidence 
data sets, where potentially biologically unlikely interac- 
tions in which the interacting partners are not localized in 
the same cellular compartment, have been deleted. As our 
examples will show, this gives novel options of interactome 
analysis and also suggests potentially new subcellular local- 
izations and localization-based functions. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE 
Overview of ComPPI 
Our goal by constructing ComPPI was to provide a reli- 
able subcellular compartment-based protein–protein inter- 
action database for the analysis of biological processes on 
the subcellular level. A key feature of ComPPI is that it al- 
lows the filtering of localization-based biologically unlikely 
interactions resulting in localization-wise more reliable in- 
teraction data. During the integration of 17 databases to 
build up ComPPI, we used the following four curation steps 
to improve data quality (Figure 1). (i) Source databases 
were selected by comparing them to a large number of 
other potential databases and their data content was man- 
ually reviewed. (ii) Subcellular localization data were con- 
sistently structured to a hierarchical subcellular localization 
tree (Supplementary Figure S2) containing more than 1600 
individual sublocalizations. (iii) We developed an algorithm 
to map different protein naming conventions to UniProt ac- 
cession numbers (24,25). (iv) Finally, a manual follow-up by 
six independent experts was performed in order to revise the 
data content searching for data inconsistence and false en- 
tries, and to test the functions of the web interface (Supple- 
mentary Table S3). 
ComPPI database includes comprehensive and inte- 
grated  data  of  four  species  (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Flowchart of ComPPI construction highlighting the four cura- 
tion steps. Constructing the ComPPI database we first checked the data 
content of 24 possible input databases for false entries, data inconsistence 
and compatible data structure in order to minimize the bias in ComPPI 
coming from the input sources (1). As a consequence we selected nine 
protein–protein interaction (BioGRID (29), CCSB (30), DiP (31), DroID 
(26), HPRD (27), IntAct (32), MatrixDB (18), MINT (33) and MIPS (28)) 
and eight subcellular localization databases (eSLDB (37), GO (19), Hu- 
man Proteinpedia (34), LOCATE (38), MatrixDB (18), OrganelleDB (39), 
PA-GOSUB (36) and The Human Protein Atlas (35)) in order to inte- 
grate them into the ComPPI data set. The subcellular localization struc- 
ture was manually annotated creating a hierarchic, non-redundant subcel- 
lular localization tree using >1600 GO cellular component terms (19) for 
the standardization of the different data resolution and naming conven- 
tions (2). All input databases were connected to the ComPPI core database 
with newly built interfaces in order to improve data consistency, to al- 
low easy extensibility with new databases and to incorporate automatic 
database updates. As part of the curation steps the filtering efficiency of 
our newly built interfaces were tested on 200 random proteins for every in- 
put databases, and the interfaces were accepted only when all the requested 
false-entries and data content errors were filtered, in order to establish 
a more reliable content (Supplementary Table S3). During data integra- 
tion, different protein naming conventions were mapped to the most reli- 
able protein name. In this process we used publicly available mapping ta- 
bles (UniProt (24) and HPRD (27)). For 30% of protein names we applied 
manually built mapping tables with the help of online ID cross-reference 
services (PICR (25) and Synergizer (http://llama.mshri.on.ca/synergizer/ 
translate/)) (3). After data integration Localization and Interaction Scores 
were calculated (for detailed description see Figure 2). As an illustration we 
show the example of Figure 2 with two interacting proteins (nodes A and B 
corresponding to HSP 90-alpha A2 and Survivin, respectively) with shared 
cytosolic and nuclear localizations (light blue and orange). Node B has an 
additional membrane (yellow) subcellular localization and an extracellular 
localization (green). Numbers in the circles of nodes A and B refer to their 
Localization Scores. The Interaction Score of nodes A and B is 0.99 (see 
Figure 2 for details). The integrated ComPPI data set was manually revised 
by six independent experts (4). During the revision two of the six experts 
tested our database on 200 random proteins each to ensure high-quality 
control requirements, and searched for exact matches between the entries 
in the input sources and the ComPPI data set. All the experts searched for 
false entries, data inconsistency, protein name mapping errors in the down- 
loadable data and tested the operation of the online services as well. After 
the revision we updated our source databases, their interfaces, the subcellu- 
lar localization tree and the algorithm generating the downloadable data, 
in order to acquire all the changes proposed during the tests. As the final 
result, the webpage http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu is available for search 
and download options in order to extract the biological information in a 
user-friendly way.

component terms (19) associating these proteins with dis- 
tinct subcellular compartments. 
 
Design and implementation 
Both protein–protein interaction and subcellular localiza- 
tion data are incorporated to ComPPI automatically using 
their own interface to bridge the difference in data structure 
(Supplementary Table S3). New interfaces can be added 
without limitations. The incoming data are merged to form 
a consistent internal data pool using a comprehensive pro- 
tein name mapping algorithm, in order to deal with the re- 
dundancy in the input data sets (http://comppi.linkgroup. 
hu/help/naming conventions). The website and the down- 
loadable contents are generated from this integrated inter- 
nal data pool. All curated parts are stored in separate, yet 
interconnected containers to maintain persistency between 
ComPPI releases. 
The website follows the hierarchical model-view- 
controller design pattern to ensure the separation of the 
data layer from the business logic and the user interface. 
Each functional unit is implemented as a module to further 
support easy maintenance and extensibility. Protein search 
algorithms have been extensively optimized, and the served 
content is cached to ensure quick response times even on 
low-end infrastructure. Due to these features ComPPI can 
be easily run on a general laptop or desktop computer. 
The downloadable data sets are pre-generated and vali- 
dated automatically and manually in every release to ful- 
fill our high quality control requirements (Figure 1). The 
Python script that generates these data sets also contains 
basic tools for data retrieval and manipulation in a network- 
oriented manner, which enables the user to perform bioin- 
formatics analysis on the interactome using the open source 
code and also gives space for further improvement. 
End-user documentation is available at the website as tu- 
torials, detailed descriptions and location-specific tooltips. 
All components of ComPPI and the underlying software 
stack are open source. The source code is available in a 
revision controlled repository at http://bificomp2.sote.hu: 
22422/comppi/summary. 
Third-party tools and technologies were selected with 
open accessibility and scientific reproducibility in mind in- 
cluding the Ubuntu Linux 14.04 operating system (http: 
//ubuntu.com/), the nginx HTTP server (http://nginx.org/), 
the MySQL 5 Community Edition database server (http: 
//www.mysql.com/), the git version control system (http: 
//git-scm.com/), the PHP 5 scripting language (https://php. 
net/), the Symfony 2 PHP framework (http://symfony.com/), 
the jQuery JavaScript framework (http://jquery.com/), the 
D3.js JavaScript  library for network visualization (http: 
//d3js.org/) and the Python3 scripting language (https:// 
python.org/). 
 
Database content and access 
Input databases. The low overlap of protein–protein inter- 
action and subcellular localization databases (11) prompted 
us to integrate several source databases in order to im- 
prove data coverage and quality (Supplementary Figure S3 
and Supplementary Table S2). In this process we used pub- 
licly downloadable license-free data sources, preferably con- 
taining proteome-wide data sets. Protein–protein interac- 
tion data were selected to contain only physical interactions 
with experimental evidence coming from high-throughput, 
as well as low-throughput techniques. We incorporated the 
widely used species-specific (DroID (26), HPRD (27), Ma- 
trixDB (18) and MIPS (28)) and general (BioGRID (29), 
CCSB (30), DiP (31), IntAct (32) and MINT (33)) protein– 
protein interaction databases having high data quality, up- 
date frequency and freely downloadable latest releases for 
academic research. 
Subcellular localization data can be obtained from ex- 
perimental evidence or using predictions. Several source 
databases contained only experimentally verified subcellu- 
lar localization entries (such as Human Proteinpedia (34) 
and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) (35)). Other source 
data had only computationally predicted information (such 
as PA-GOSUB (36)). Several data sources had integrated 
data structure (such as eSLDB (37), GO (19), LOCATE 
(38), MatrixDB (18), OrganelleDB (39)) containing data of 
both experimental and predicted origin. During the selec- 
tion of the proteome-wide predicted subcellular localiza- 
tion databases with downloadable content we focused on 
the use of prediction algorithms with combined methods 
using robust machine learning tools validated on highly re- 
liable training sets. 
 
ComPPI data set. The availability of the data sources dif- 
fers between various species. As an example ComPPI con- 
tains eight protein–protein interaction and eight subcellular 
localization databases for human proteins (Supplementary 
Figure S3). Database integration was based on protein ID 
mapping to the most reliable naming convention available, 
primarily to UniProt Swiss-Prot accession numbers (11). 
The 4 curation steps (Figure 1) allow the users to access 
interaction and localization data at a single resource hav- 
ing a higher coverage and reliability than the incorporated 
databases. 
The ComPPI database contains three types of predefined 
data sets: (i) the compartmentalized interactome catalogues 
of those protein–protein interactions, where the interacting 
proteins have at least one common subcellular localization, 
(ii) the integrated protein–protein interaction data set which 
can be customized by the four species included and (iii) the 
subcellular localization data set, which is one of the biggest 
existing subcellular localization resource with a comprehen- 
sive structure for interactome analysis. All downloadable 
ComPPI resources are license free and publicly available for 
academic and industrial research. 
 
Search and download features 
Search features. The internally hyper-linked web applica- 
tion of ComPPI enables even those users, who have no 
bioinformatics expertise, to search for the interactions of in- 
dividual proteins. Search options (http://comppi.linkgroup. 
hu/protein search) are available for protein names with au- 
tocomplete function giving their subcellular localization, 
their interactions and the likelihood of their interactions 
considering the subcellular localization of the interacting 
partners. Using the Advanced Settings of the Search page

the user is able to filter the list of the possible query pro- 
teins for species, subcellular localizations and/or localiza- 
tion probability. These settings can be set for the interactors 
of the query protein too and are adjustable with the Custom 
Settings on the Results page, which allows the filtering of the 
interactors for subcellular localizations, localization prob- 
ability and interaction score. The properties of the query 
protein and its interactors are available for download. Af- 
ter filtration only those interactions are exported that ful- 
fill the custom filtering requirements set by the user. Net- 
work visualization of the whole or filtered first-neighbour 
interactome of the query protein is also available, where 
the width of the edges corresponds to the Interaction Score 
of the given interaction. These options together provide a 
user-friendly web interface for data mining for both non- 
experts and computational biologists. A Direct Search op- 
tion is also available via URL, which gives the opportunity 
to interconnect the ComPPI database with other resources, 
or to generate multiple searches for data mining. 
Download options. All ComPPI data are available for 
download at the website. Predefined data sets can be cus- 
tomized by the user to contain only data for a requested 
species or localization: (i) Compartmentalized interactomes 
have interactions, where the two interacting protein-nodes 
have at least one common subcellular localization. These in- 
teractomes can be filtered to species besides subcellular lo- 
calizations. (ii) Integrated protein–protein interaction data 
sets contain all the interactions, and can be customized to 
the four species included. (iii) Integrated subcellular local- 
ization data sets contain proteins together with their local- 
ization data. The user can select species and localizations 
to customize these data sets. (iv) The current and previ- 
ous releases of the full database can also be downloaded. A 
detailed help and a tutorial for the Search and Download 
functions are both available. 
Output. ComPPI output data provide lists of interactions, 
interaction scores of the interacting proteins and localiza- 
tions with localization scores. Moreover, the user receives 
the PubMed IDs and references of the source databases 
for both the interactions and subcellular localizations, and 
the additional information (if available) of the data type. 
The user-defined interactomes as results of the Basic or Ad- 
vanced Search options and the predefined data sets on the 
Downloads page are available for download in plain text 
format to ensure convenient data handling. The complete 
current and previous releases of the database are download- 
able in SQL format to provide full access to all the data in 
ComPPI. 
 
Localization and interaction scores 
Subcellular localization structure. Subcellular localization 
data are coming from different source databases, contain- 
ing localizations having experimental evidence (in the fol- 
lowings: experimental), coming from unknown sources (un- 
known) or predictions (predicted; Figure 2). Experimental 
data usually have high resolution, where the exact localiza- 
tion of the protein is often defined, such as the nuclear pore 
complex for Nup107 (40). Predicted localizations have usu- 
ally low resolution. As an example nuclear localization can 
be predicted from the existence of a nuclear localization sig- 
nal in the amino acid sequence (41) without any experimen- 
tal evidence. 
Because of the incongruity in the resolution of the lo- 
calization data and the different naming conventions be- 
tween the source databases, we standardized the subcellu- 
lar localization data using GO cellular component terms 
(19). In order to solve the problem of the unequivocally 
mapped GO terms (Figure 3) we created a manually built, 
non-redundant, hierarchical localization tree (Supplemen- 
tary Figure S2). With the help of this we clustered the >1600 
GO cellular component terms to six major compartments 
(cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, secretory-pathway, mem- 
brane, extracellular) (Supplementary Table S4). This new 
structure allows ComPPI to store all localization entries 
from different sources and to assign the proteins efficiently 
to six major compartments (Figure 3 and Supplementary 
Figure S4). 
 
Localization and interaction scores. The ComPPI Local- 
ization Score is a novel measure to score the probabil- 
ity of a localization for a given protein. The Localiza- 
tion Score depends on the subcellular localization evidence 
type (experimental, unknown, predicted) and the number 
of sources (Figure 2). The Interaction Score characterizes 
the probability of the subcellular localization of a protein– 
protein interaction, and is based on the consensus of the 
compartment-specific Localization Scores of the interacting 
proteins. With the help of the scoring algorithm ComPPI 
provides a novel localization probability describing how 
likely it is that the protein exists in the given subcellu- 
lar compartment, and gives the opportunity to build high- 
confidence interactomes based on the distribution of the in- 
teraction scores (Supplementary Figure S5). 
Localization Scores are calculated using probabilistic dis- 
junction (marked with operator V) among the different lo- 
calization evidence types and the number of ComPPI local- 
ization data entries of the respective evidence type (Equa- 
tion (1), see top panel of Figure 2 for details) 
ϕLocX = Vres pLocX 
(1) 
where ϕLocX and pLocX are the Localization Score and the 
localization evidence type (experimental, unknown or pre- 
dicted) for protein X and localization Loc, respectively, 
while res is the number of available ComPPI localization 
data entries for protein X. 
As the first step of Interaction Score calculation, 
compartment-specific Interaction Scores are obtained by 
multiplying the Localization Scores of the two interactors 
for each of the six major compartments. Finally, the Inter- 
action Score is calculated as the probabilistic disjunction 
(marked with operator V) of the Compartment-specific In- 
teraction Scores of all major localizations available for the 
interacting pair from the maximal number of six major lo- 
calizations (Equation (2), see bottom panel of Figure 2 for 
details) 
ϕInt = V6   ϕLocA ∗ ϕLocB 
(2) 
where ϕInt  is the Interaction Score, while ϕLocA  and ϕLocB 
are the Compartment-specific Localization Scores of inter- 
acting proteins A and B, respectively.

Figure 2. Calculation of the subcellular localization-based ComPPI scores. We illustrate the Localization Score calculation steps on the examples of Heat 
Shock Protein (HSP) 90-apha A2 and Survivin. HSP 90-alpha A2 has two major subcellular localizations, while Survivin has four (ϕnucleusA, ϕcytoA and 
ϕextracellularB, ϕmembraneB, ϕnucleusB, ϕcytoB, respectively). Localizations were manually categorized into major localizations before the calculation (see the 
text in section ‘Subcellular Localization Structure’ for details). (A) A Localization Score (such as <cytoA) is calculated for every available major subcellular 
localization for both HSP 90-alpha A2 and Survivin based on the available localization evidence types and the number of the respective localization data 
entries (corresponding to pLocX and Vrec of Equation (1)). The Localization Score calculation uses the optimized localization evidence type weights of 
0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 for experimental, predicted or unknown localization evidence types, respectively. (For details of the weight optimization procedure see 
section ‘Score Optimization’ of the main text and Supplementary Figure S6.) The Localization Score (i.e. the likelihood for the respective protein to 
belong to a major compartment) is represented by the probabilistic disjunction among the different localization evidence types and the number of ComPPI 
localization data entries of the respective evidence type (Equation (1)). (B) Calculation of the Interaction Score (ϕInt) is based on the Localization Scores of 
the interacting proteins. First, Compartment-specific Interaction Scores (such as ϕcytoInt) are calculated as pair-wise products of the relevant Localization 
Scores of the two interacting proteins (HSP 90-alpha A2 and Survivin). The final Interaction Score (ϕInt) is calculated as the probabilistic disjunction of 
the Compartment-specific Interaction Scores of all major localizations available for the interacting pair of proteins (in the example four major localizations 
for HSP 90-alpha A2 and Survivin) from the maximal number of six major localizations (Equation (2)).

Figure 3. Advantages of ComPPI subcellular localization structure. The 
subcellular localization structure of ComPPI is based on a manually cu- 
rated, non-redundant subcellular localization tree extracted from GO data 
(19) containing more than 1600 GO cellular component terms (Supple- 
mentary Figure S2). On Figure 3 an example of the redundancy in the GO 
cellular component tree structure is shown, where the ‘nuclear pore’ cellu- 
lar component can be found under several branches in the tree, such as in 
the ‘nucleus’ -> ‘nuclear envelope’ -> ‘nuclear pore’ or the ‘membrane’ -> 
‘membrane part’ -> ‘intrinsic component of the membrane’ -> ‘integral 
component of the membrane’ -> ‘pore complex’ pathways (highlighted in 
red). Because of the need of the mapping of high-resolution subcellular lo- 
calization data into major cellular components (Supplementary Table S4) a 
localization tree with a non-redundant structure was built. In our example, 
it can be seen that with the help of this structure the ‘nuclear pore’ derives 
unequivocally from the ‘nuclear envelope’ term (highlighted in green). 
 
 
Score optimization. As mentioned before the ComPPI lo- 
calization evidence type can be experimental, unknown or 
predicted. ComPPI characterizes each of these localiza- 
tion evidence types by a parameter called the evidence type 
weight to achieve a unified scoring system applicable to the 
diverse data sources. To obtain these evidence type weights 
we performed their data-driven optimization. Based on the 
fact that experimentally validated entries are the most re- 
liable, while localization entries coming from unknown or 
predicted origin are less reliable, we set the following order 
of evidence type weights: experimental > predicted AND 
experimental > unknown as the two requirements of the 
optimization process. We chose the HPA database (35) con- 
taining only experimentally verified subcellular localiza- 
tions in order to build a positive control data set, where the 
interactors have at least one common localization accord- 
ing to HPA. Our goal was to find a specific ratio of the ex- 
perimental, unknown and predicted evidence type weights 
that maximizes the number of high confidence interactions 
in the positive control data set (HPA) and simultaneously 
maximizes the number of low confidence interactions in the 
ComPPI data set not containing HPA data. These ensure 
that the quality of data marked as high confidence will have 
a good match to the quality of experimentally verified data. 
 
 
All combinations of the experimental, unknown and pre- 
dicted evidence type weights were set up from 0 to 1 with 
0.1 increments. The kernel density of the interactions were 
calculated with all these settings (with a bandwidth of 0.01), 
which gave us the ratio of interactions belonging to a given 
confidence level compared to the distribution of all the in- 
teractions. Finally, the 285 possible kernel density solutions 
were tested to find the parameter combination that maxi- 
mizes the number of both the low and high confidence inter- 
actions as described above. This resulted in 0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 
as the relative evidence type weights for experimental, pre- 
dicted and unknown data types, respectively (Supplemen- 
tary Figure S6). Note that this optimization is driven by the 
reliability of the subcellular localization data, and was not 
tested using gold standard protein–protein interaction data 
sets, therefore the Interaction Score reflects the reliability of 
the interaction in a subcellular localization-dependent but 
not in an interactome-dependent manner. 
 
Application examples 
Merging  of  subcellular  localization  and  interactome 
data provides several application opportunities: (i) the 
filtration 
of 
localization-based 
biologically 
unlikely 
interactions––where the two interacting proteins have no 
common localization and (ii) the prediction of possible new 
localizations and  localization-based biological  functions 
(15). Both are important features of ComPPI as illustrated 
by an example in this section. 
 
ComPPI-based interaction filtering. First, we made a sys- 
tematic search for an example, which highlights the impor- 
tance of the removal of localization-based biologically un- 
likely interactions looking for key hubs and bridges, where 
interaction structure changed the most after the filtering 
step. Here we calculated the degree distribution of the whole 
human interactome and the high-confidence interactome 
(containing 23 265/19 386 proteins and their 385 481/260 
829 interactions, respectively) where from the latter biolog- 
ically unlikely interactions with no common subcellular lo- 
calizations have already been removed. We also calculated 
the distribution of the betweenness centrality in the two 
data sets. After these procedures we manually reviewed the 
first 20 proteins from the UniProt Swiss-Prot subset (15 258 
proteins out of 19 386) with the highest differences in degree 
and centrality measures (Supplementary Table S5). Enoyl- 
CoA hydratase (crotonase) had the largest absolute change 
of degree among the top 20 proteins, thus we selected cro- 
tonase as our illustrative example (Figure 4). Crotonase 
catalyses the second step in the beta-oxidation pathway of 
fatty acid metabolism (42), and is a key member of the cro- 
tonase protein superfamily (43). Beta-oxidation takes place 
primarily in the mitochondrion (44). Crotonase has only a 
mitochondrial ComPPI localization with experimental evi- 
dence, which is in agreement with its cellular function. 
Crotonase has 71 interacting partners in the integrated 
data set, of which only 8 is present in the mitochondrion, 
and only 5 have an interaction score equal or higher than 
1.8. After the manual review of crotonase neighbours, it 
turned out that only one of the 8 mitochondrial interactors 
(mitochondrial Hsp70, (45)) has experimental evidence for

Figure 4. Advantages of the ComPPI data set to filter biologically unlikely 
interactions and to predict compartment-specific, new properties and func- 
tions. The figure shows the interactions of crotonase (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 
UniProt ID: P30084), involved in fatty acid catabolism having a mitochon- 
drial localization, and its first neighbours supported with experimental 
evidence before and after filtering to mitochondrial localization. Interac- 
tions with an Interaction Score below 0.80 are shown with dashed lines. On 
one hand, out of the original 71 neighbours of crotonase only 8 remain as 
mitochondrial interacting partners with a significantly higher average In- 
teraction Score than the whole first-neighbour network, which highlights 
the importance of compartment-specific filtering in the detection of high- 
confidence interactors in a subcellular localization-dependent manner. On 
the other hand, the blue circle of the upper left side of the figure shows 
those cytosolic crotonase interacting partners, which are involved in apop- 
tosis, a recently discovered function of crotonase (47–47). Thus, the very 
same example also reveals a potential new function of crotonase, which 
partially involves its unexpected cytosolic localization, which was recently 
verified experimentally (46). 
 
 
 
mitochondrial localization. Mitochondrial localization of 
the other 7 interactors is not based on strong evidence, while 
63 out of 71 interactors have no known mitochondrial local- 
ization at all. Figure 4 shows the interactome of crotonase 
and its 71 first neighbours containing 428 edges. In the mito- 
chondrial interaction subset only 13 edges remained, while 
the high-confidence part contains only 10 interactions (Fig- 
ure 4). Second neighbours of crotonase contain 82% of the 
interactome, and their network contains 14 803 nodes and 
319 305 edges. The filtered mitochondrial network of the 
second neighbours is much smaller, having only 2107 nodes 
and 8381 interactions. 
ComPPI-based prediction of new or non-conventional func- 
tions. Importantly, 52 out of the 71 interactors, and more 
specifically, 7 out of the 8 mitochondrial interacting part- 
ners of crotonase have cytosolic localization with a lo- 
calization probability over 0.95. This indicates that cro- 
tonase may have a cytosolic localization as well. Indeed, 
crotonase was shown to be overexpressed and localized in 
the cytosol in hepatocarcinoma cells, where it contributes 
to lymphatic metastatis (46). GO (19) biological process 
term enrichment analysis of the mitochondrial crotonase 
interacting partners using BiNGO (21) revealed that be- 
sides the known function of the crotonase in ‘catabolic pro- 
cess’ the ‘negative regulation of apoptosis’ and related terms 
were also significantly enriched (Supplementary Table S6). 
In agreement with this, previous studies showed that cro- 
tonase is overexpressed in several cancer types (47), and 
the knockdown of crotonase decreased cell viability and en- 
hanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carci- 
noma (48). The anti-apoptotic effect of crotonase also ex- 
ists in breast cancer, where its down-regulation potentiates 
PP2-induced apoptosis (49). 
These findings may implicate that the high ratio of ‘bi- 
ologically unlikely’ interactions may also be a result of 
a transient and dynamic cytosolic subcellular localization 
of crotonase, where the enzyme may be involved in cur- 
rently not widely crotonase-associated biological processes, 
such as the inhibition of apoptosis. Importantly, these 
compartment-specific crotonase functions may be applied 
as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of hepato- 
cellular carcinoma or breast cancer. 
In summary, the crotonase example shows the utility 
of ComPPI both (i) to filter low-confidence interactions 
concentrating on high-confidence subcellular localizations 
and (ii) to predict unknown biological functions in previ- 
ously unknown or non-conventional subcellular localiza- 
tions. Another example of ComPPI-based prediction of po- 
tential, novel functions besides crotonase, is Monopolar 
Spindle 1 protein (MPS1) having a centromere-associated 
cytosolic localization (50). We identified a number of rela- 
tively undiscovered MPS1 functions related to the ComPPI 
analysis of nuclear MPS1 interactome as detailed in Sup- 
plementary Figure S7 and Supplementary Table S6. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In summary, ComPPI provides a unique data set for the 
analysis of protein–protein interaction networks at the sub- 
cellular level. The assembly of the integrated ComPPI 
database with manual curation protocols (Figure 1) pro- 
vides an improvement of both coverage and data quality. 
ComPPI subcellular localization data have a novel struc- 
ture in order to incorporate localizations from different 
data sources (Figure 3 and  Supplementary  Figure  S4), 
and to reveal compartment-specific biological functions 
based on the analysis of the interactomes extended with 
high-resolution localization data in a hierarchical struc- 
ture. With the use of the optimized Localization and In- 
teraction Scores (Figure 2) high-confidence interactomes 
could be created for further investigation in the field of 
compartment-specific biological processes (15).

Comparison of integrated protein–protein interaction 
data and the compartmentalized interactome allow the fil- 
tering of biologically unlikely interactions, where the inter- 
acting partners have no common subcellular localization. 
Our examples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S7) il- 
lustrate that besides filtering, ComPPI has a strong predic- 
tive power to find new localizations of the proteins based 
on the underlying network or to suggest new compartment- 
specific biological functions. The comprehensive data set for 
four species gives the opportunity to analyse evolutionary 
aspects of the compartmentalization, such as the prediction 
of subcellular localization ortologes (‘localogs’). 
The 
web 
interface 
of 
ComPPI 
(http://ComPPI. 
LinkGroup.hu) provides user-friendly search and down- 
load options. Besides the basic Search feature to explore 
and download the interactions of individual proteins, 
Advanced Settings could be applied to both query proteins 
and their interactors. Interactome-wide studies could be 
applied using the downloadable compartment-specific 
interactomes or the integrated protein–protein interaction 
data set, while the integrated subcellular localization data 
set is also available on the webpage for further analyses. 
ComPPI is available at http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu, 
and has an open source code, which allows further improve- 
ment and the construction of ‘ComPPI-based databases’. 
ComPPI is a community-annotated resource, which will 
be continuously enriched by a user community of experts 
helped by a public issue-tracking system and by feedbacks 
from the core-team, and will be updated and upgraded an- 
nually for minimum 5 years. 
We plan to resolve current ComPPI limitations, such as 
the relatively low amount (29% of total) of experimental 
subcellular localization entries with the incorporation of 
newly available experimental data. Future plans include the 
development of improved gold standard-based Localiza- 
tion and network neighbourhood-based Interaction Scores, 
as well as further advanced download and search options, 
such as advanced localization-based network visualization 
and extended number of output formats. 
In summary, the ComPPI-based interactomes introduced 
here provide a broader coverage, offer highly structured 
subcellular localization data, as well as offer Localization 
and Interaction confidence Scores, all in a user-friendly 
manner. Importantly, ComPPI enables the user to filter bi- 
ologically unlikely interactions, where the two interacting 
proteins have no common subcellular localizations, and to 
predict novel subcellular localization as well as localization- 
based properties, such as compartment-specific biological 
functions.

Supplementary Figure S1. The role of multiple subcellular localizations on the example of 
IGFBP-2 and HIF-1 Alpha proteins. 
 
Panel (A) depicts the compartment-specific functions of IGFBP-2. IGFBP-2 is a secreted (dark blue), 
predominantly extracellular (green) protein involved in insulin growth factor (IGF) signalling (1). 
IGFBP-2 is also localized in the nucleus (orange), where it is required for the activation of VEGF-
mediated angiogenesis (2). This binary function of IGFBP-2 turned out to be an important prognostic 
biomarker in several cancer types, such as breast cancer (3). Panel (B) shows another important 
example, HIF-1 Alpha, which is a member of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family, and has a key 
importance in the maintenance of cellular oxygen homeostasis, particularly in the response to hypoxia 
(4). In order to act as a transcription factor, HIF-1 Alpha has to translocate from the cytosol (light blue) 
into the nucleus (orange). HIF-1 Alpha and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) 
form a heterodimer in the nucleus, which is required for their stable nuclear association (5). This 
regulated transport has key role in HIF-1 Alpha activity control both in healthy conditions (6) and in the 
development of cancer (7).

Supplementary Figure S2. The localization tree used for the ComPPI subcellular localization data 
integration. 
 
ComPPI subcellular localization data are assembled from several sources with different naming 
conventions and resolution, therefore a standardization step is required before integration. We built a 
non-redundant, hierarchical subcellular localization tree based on more than 1,600 Gene Ontology (8) 
cellular component terms manually. The tree structure is needed to separate the high resolution 
subcellular localization data unequivocally to the 6 major cellular compartments of low resolution for 
further analysis (Supplementary Table S4). On the example shown we demonstrate the tree structure 
on a segment of the hierarchical subcellular localization tree with the nucleus in focus. The high 
resolution data, such as the components of the nuclear pore complex, are highlighted in orange at the 
bottom 
part 
of

Supplementary Figure S3. The overlap between subcellular localization and protein-protein 
interaction input databases used in the assembly of ComPPI.  
 
Panels (A) and (B) show the overlap between the source subcellular localization and protein-protein 
interaction (interactome) databases graphically for all the data and after filtering by species as well. 
Nodes in the networks symbolize the source databases, their size is proportional to the number of 
proteins originated from the given database. Edges connecting the nodes represent the overlap, their 
width correlates with the number of common proteins in the interconnected databases. Interestingly, 
these graphs are fully connected, e.g. all databases share proteins with each other (except DroID, a D. 
melanogaster-specific database, which has no overlap with databases lacking fruit fly data). The 
reason is usually the redundancy between the databases (for example MINT and IntAct share their 
data as part of the MIntAct project (9)).  
Panels (C) and (D) display numerically the same data as Panel (A) and (B), respectively: the number 
of proteins (Y axis) are plotted for every input database (X axis), each bar represents an edge from 
Panel (A) or (B). Significant differences can be observed in the amount of source data provided by the 
input databases. 
Panel (E) shows the number of proteins (Y axis) per source database (X axis) for the given species 
compared to the number of proteins in ComPPI (highlighted in orange). The number of common 
proteins in all source databases, in databases with more than 5000 proteins, and only in interactome 
databases are also represented on the charts. Panel (F) shows the number of interactions (Y axis) for 
the given species per interactome source databases (X axis) compared to the number of proteins in 
ComPPI (highlighted in orange).

Supplementary Figure S4. Advantages of multiple localization evidence. 
 
The Venn-diagrams represents the number of proteins with experimental, unknown, predicted, or 
mixed localization evidence in the integrated ComPPI subcellular localization dataset and in the sub-
dataset of ComPPI containing GO-based localization data for its proteins. Interestingly, the number of 
proteins with only unknown localization evidence is much lower in ComPPI compared to its GO-subset 
(57%), while the number of proteins with experimental (264%) and mixed evidence (376%) is higher, 
than the estimation based on the number of proteins in ComPPI compared to the GO sub-dataset 
(203%). These findings implicate that the integration of subcellular localization data from different 
sources having different localization evidence types increases not only the quantity of the data, but 
their reliability as well.

Supplementary Figure S5. The distribution of the ComPPI Localization and Interaction Scores. 
 
Panel (A) shows the distribution histogram of the Localization Scores for the 4 species of ComPPI 
separated by the 6 major cellular compartments containing all subcellular localization data. The X axis 
represents the confidence intervals of the Localization Score between 0 and 1 by 0.1 increments, 
while the Y axis shows the number of proteins belonging to the given compartment. On panel (B) the 
distribution histogram of the Interaction Scores is shown for the 4 species of ComPPI containing the 
integrated protein-protein interaction data. The X axis depicts the confidence intervals of the 
Interaction Score between 0 and 1 by 0.1 increments, while the Y axis shows the number of 
interactions in the given confidence interval. See more about the Localization and Interaction Scores 
in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S6.

Supplementary Figure S6. Optimization of the ComPPI localization evidence type weights. 
 
The flowchart on panel (A) shows the steps of ComPPI localization evidence type weight optimization. 
Our goal was to define the ratio of the localization evidence type weights to each other, and to set up a 
threshold, above which the interactions are considered trustworthy, i.e. as 'high confidence' as the 
known experimental data. Localization evidence types can be experimental, unknown and predicted. 
For more details, see the “Localization and Interaction Scores” section in the main text. Each evidence 
type has a parameter that defines its weight against the other two types, termed as localization 
evidence type weights. To define these weights, we built a positive-control dataset containing only 
those interactions, where both interactors are localized in the same subcellular compartment, and this 
information was supported with experimental evidence from the Human Protein Atlas database (HPA, 
32). We compared the positive-control dataset (56,160 interactions, in green) to all the interactions 
from the ComPPI dataset excluding the subcellular localization data from HPA (790,269 interactions, 
in grey). Based on the fact that experimentally validated entries are the most reliable, while localization 
entries coming from unknown or predicted origin are less reliable, we set the following order of 
evidence type weights: experimental > predicted AND experimental > unknown as the two 
requirements of the optimization process. All combinations of the experimental, unknown and 
predicted localization evidence type weights were set up from 0 to 1 with 0.1 increments. The kernel 
density of the interactions were calculated using all these settings, which gave us the ratio of 
interactions belonging to a given confidence level compared to the distribution of all the interactions. 
Our goal was to find a specific ratio of the experimental, unknown and predicted localization evidence 
type weight parameters that maximizes the number of high confidence (HQ) interactions in the positive 
control dataset (HPA) and simultaneously maximizes the number of low confidence (LQ) interactions 
in the ComPPI dataset not containing HPA data. These ensure that the quality of data marked as high 
confidence will match the quality of experimentally verified data. We calculated the 95% confidence 
threshold (in red) for the positive-control dataset in order to separate our data into high- and low-
confidence subsets for all the 285 solutions. The 285 possible kernel density solutions were tested to 
find the parameter combination that maximizes the number of both the low and high confidence 
interactions as described above. The number of HQ HPA interactions is much lower than the number 
of LQ interactions, therefore these had to be normalized to avoid any statistical bias. The normalized 
values were multiplied to obtain a single value representing the combination of the specific 
experimental, unknown and predicted localization evidence type weights. We simultaneously 
maximized the number of interactions in the high-confidence positive control dataset (HQ HPA) and 
the number of interactions in the low-confidence subset of all the ComPPI interactions not containing 
HPA (LQ ALL):  
  
 
(Eq.1) 
The single values were ranked and the largest one was selected, that represented the localization 
evidence type weights of 0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 for the experimental, predicted and unknown localization 
evidence types, respectively. Panel (B) illustrates the distribution of the Interaction Score after

optimization. The X axis shows the Interaction Score, while the Y axis represents the kernel density of 
the interaction distribution. The figure shows that Interaction Score distribution for the positive-control 
dataset (56,160 interactions, in green) and for the interactions not containing HPA localizations 
(790,269 interactions, in grey), which had the largest value of Eq. 1, i.e. which had the optimal set of 
localization evidence type weights out of the possible 285 representations. The number of high-
confidence interactions in the positive-control dataset with a confidence threshold at 95% equalled 
48,567, while the number of high-confidence interactions in the ComPPI dataset excluding HPA was 
241,076 (30% of total). The optimal distribution shown represented the 0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 localization 
evidence type weight set for the experimental, predicted and unknown localization evidence types, 
respectively. The relatively low weight (0.8) of the experimental evidence type means that (i) a single 
evidence does not result in highly trusted subcellular localization and (ii) at least two pieces of 
experimental evidence are required to have a localization score above 95%. The relatively high weight 
(0.7) of the predicted evidence type is in agreement with the high reliability of subcellular localization 
prediction methods, while the low weight (0.3) of the unknown evidence type highlights the need of the 
validation of data origin. These facts taken together highlight the importance of data integration and 
allow a strong filtering of the ComPPI dataset resulting in reliable high-confidence interactions.

Supplementary Figure S7. Advantages of ComPPI: prediction of compartment-specific, new 
properties and functions of MPS1. 
 
The figure shows another example of ComPPI-based prediction of potential, novel functions besides 
the example of crotonase detailed in the main text. We choose a well-known dual-specific protein 
kinase, the Monopolar Spindle 1 protein (MPS1, UniProt ID: P33981) having a centromere-associated 
cytosolic localization (10) and relatively undiscovered functions in its nuclear subcellular localization 
resulting in incomplete knowledge of the effect of its inhibitors. MPS1 is a member of the spindle 
assembly checkpoint complex (11), and its inhibition causes aneuploidy via mitotic arrest resulting in 
apoptosis (12). Importantly, MPS1 also has a nuclear localization (13), which is independent from its 
inhibition (14). MPS1 inhibitors are potent anticancer drugs with well-characterized pharmacological 
effects (15). These findings raise the idea that MPS1 may have still unknown effects in the nucleus 
after its inhibition. However, the exact role of MPS1 in the nucleus remains rather unclear. As one of 
the sporadic pieces of related evidence MPS1 mediates epigenetic functions, such as the regulation of 
the chromatin organization through the phosphorylation of Condensin-2 (16). Additionally, MPS1 has a 
still unknown function attached to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (13). In ComPPI 
has MPS1 has 40 interacting partners. Supplementary Figure S7 shows the interactions of the MPS1 
kinase and its first neighbours before and after filtering to nuclear localization using an Interaction 
Score threshold of 0.90. 28 of the total 40 of its interactors (70%) have nuclear localization. This result 
proposes a more extensive nuclear function of MPS1 than previously suspected. To assess the 
putative nuclear functions of MPS1, we built the interactome of the first and second neighbours of 
MPS1, and filtered them for nuclear interactions. Gene Ontology (8) enrichment analysis using BiNGO 
(17) showed that besides the already known MPS1-related biological functions, such as ‘mitotic cell 
cycle checkpoint’ or ‘chromosome separation’, additional functions, such as ‘cellular component 
organization’, ‘organelle organization’ and related terms also showed a significant enrichment 
(Supplementary Table S6). This is in agreement with the earlier suggestion that MPS1 may have a 
role in nuclear assembly and cellular component reorganization during mitosis possibly related to its 
localization in the nuclear pore complex (13). The assessment of the function of first and second 
MPS1 neighbours revealed 3 second neighbours playing key role in nuclear assembly, (Lamin-B2 
(18), LAP2 (19) and Emerin (20)), and 3 others involved in epigenetic regulation of chromatin 
condensation and decondensation (Aurora kinase B (21) and C (22), as well as histone 
acetyltransferase p300 (23)). Lamin B2 is connected to MPS1 through its 2 first neighbours, where 
one of them is the VCP protein (highlighted in green circle). VCP is involved in DNA-damage response 
(24), and is known as a regulator of the nuclear envelope reassembly (25). Additionally, three of the 
first neighbours of MPS1 are members of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) 
(highlighted in red circle), a complex having key role in the maintenance of the spindle assembly 
checkpoint by the ubiquitination of the Cdc20 (26). Furthermore, APC/C mediates the degradation of 
MPS1 and helps the coordination of the re-entry to the cell cycle during environmental stress (27), 
which can be a rescue mechanism for cancer cells as well. The potential function of MPS1 in nuclear 
reassembly needs further investigation and experimental validation. Despite this uncertainty, this 
example also highlights the importance of the analysis of compartment-specific sub-networks and the 
predictive power of ComPPI.

Supplementary Table S1. Comparison of ComPPI with similar tools and databases. 
 
ComPPI is a unique resource, with an integrated protein-protein interaction dataset enriched by the 
subcellular localization of the interactors, in order to perform more reliable compartment-specific 
analysis of biological processes. We present here only those key examples from the wide set of tools, 
databases and scoring algorithms, that had similar purposes to those of ComPPI. Besides a brief 
summary some key advantages and disadvantages of the resources, and references to them are 
listed. These tools and databases are open source, and mainly use Gene Ontology (8) based 
subcellular localization annotations. See Figure 3 in the main text and Supplementary Figures S3 and 
S4 for the advantages of the ComPPI structure and the comparison to the integrated source 
databases.

Supplementary Table S3. Comparison of the ComPPI content to the input databases, and the 
effects of our filtering algorithms and manual validation steps. 
 
The table shows the number of interaction and localization entries in the source databases and the 
number of them loaded into ComPPI. Different input sources are connected to the ComPPI database 
structure using source-specific interfaces. During autoloading or manual validation steps (see Figure 1 
for more details in the main text) we filtered out those interactions or localizations from the source 
databases, that (1) did not the requirements of ComPPI (e.g. genetic interactions in BioGRID or 
localizations in PA-GOSUB with a confidence level below 95%), (2) contained errors in their data 
structure (e.g. entries with inconsequent nomenclature), or those that (3) turned out to be biologically 
unlikely during our manual review process. We also mapped the different subcellular localization 
naming conventions to GO (8) cellular component terms for standardization purposes (Supplementary 
Figure S2). The source databases have different protein naming conventions, thus we had to map 
these protein names to the most reliable naming convention (visit the relevant Help page for more 
details: http://comppi.linkgroup.hu/help/naming_conventions). Due to the inconsistencies in protein 
naming conventions some protein names may be mapped to multiple other protein names.  For 
instance, gene IDs could be mapped to several protein IDs, which phenomenon is based on real 
biological processes, such as alternative splicing. This may result in more protein names associated 
with a given source than the number of proteins taken from the original source. There are some other 
cases, where protein names could not be mapped to the strongest protein naming convention. In 
these cases we dropped the entry, so it was not incorporated into the database. Another important 
point is that we developed an algorithm in order to export the predefined datasets from the ComPPI 
database structure. The export module also went through rigorous manual revision in order to ensure 
that there are exact matches between the source data and the output data from ComPPI (see 
Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S2 for more details about our output data). Relevant information 
of the efficiency of manual curation could be gained in those cases, where source databases, such as 
MatrixDB and HPRD use matching protein name conventions and have a consequent data structure. 
Taking these facts together this table shows the summarized effect of filtering due to the manual 
curation protocols, the filtering due to our special requirements of incorporated data, and the effect of 
the protein name mapping.

Supplementary Table S4. Mapping of high resolution subcellular localization data into major 
cellular components. 
 
Subcellular localization data come from several sources with different resolution. Therefore, the 
integration of high resolution data into major cellular components with low resolution is needed. The 
high resolution localization data were mapped manually to the possibly largest and most accurate 
subcellular localizations based on the hierarchical branches (parent and children branches) of the 
localization tree (Supplementary Figure S2). One or more parent branches were associated with one 
of the 6 major subcellular components (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, secretory-pathway, 
membrane and extracellular) as shown on the table. Thus, using the united, hierarchical localization 
tree we gained low resolution major cellular components, in which there is an unambiguous route in 
the tree to one major subcellular component. If a given GO term belongs to an included branch, but it 
is located in another major cellular component, then this GO term will be excluded during the mapping. 
Currently the localization tree contains 1,644 GO cellular component terms. The number of GO terms 
belonging to a given major cellular component is also shown in the last column of the table. The 
mapping table of major cellular components is available online here:

Supplementary Table S5. Importance of the removal of localization-based biologically unlikely 
interactions. 
 
The table demonstrates the importance of the removal of biologically unlikely interactions based on 
their localization data. We compared the degree and the betweeness centrality (BC) of the proteins in 
the integrated protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset without subcellular localizations and to the 
compartmentalized interactome, where the proteins have at least one common subcellular localization. 
The proteins were ranked by the size of the alternations in the degree (Δ Degree (%)) and BC 
measures, and only the proteins with UniProt Swiss-Prot (28) name were kept (15,258 proteins out of 
19,386) for more reliable further analysis. The table shows the first 20 proteins, ordered by the degree 
difference between the compartmentalized dataset and the integrated PPI dataset (Δ Degree). The 
subcellular localization of the proteins are also displayed, these can be: (i) subcellular localizations 
after the compartmentalization (Compartmentalized Localization), (ii) localizations that were 
represented in the first-neighbours of the interactome with less than 5% ratio (Filtered Localizations), 
(iii) the predicted localizations, where more than 95% of the first-neighbours are localized in the given 
compartment (Possible Localizations), and (iv) the localizations that were represented among the first-
neighbours  with a range between 5 and 95% (Uncertain Localizations). The table gives information 
about how many proteins have no localization data among the first-neighbours, and gives an average 
Interaction Score (IS) for the interactions before and after filtering. Our application example is the 
Crotonase (Enoyl-CoA hydratase), which is the first in the list (highlighted in yellow). See Figure 4 in 
the main text for more details.

Supplementary Table S6. The results of the Gene Ontology biological process enrichment 
analysis of the two example proteins, crotonase and MPS1. 
 
The table shows the results of the Gene Ontology (8) biological process term enrichment analysis 
using BiNGO (17). Our two application examples are crotonase (see Figure 4 in the main text for more 
details) and MPS1 (see Supplementary Figure S7 for more details) to demonstrate how ComPPI is 
useful in the filtering of biologically unlikely interactions and prediction in the new protein properties 
and functions. The upper part of the table shows the first 15 biological process terms in order of their 
corrected significance from the analysis of the mitochondrial subset of the first-neighbours of 
crotonase. Importantly, the most significant biological process is the ‘anti-apoptosis’ (highlighted in 
yellow), while related terms are also highly represented in the list. Known functions of crotonase, such 
as ‘positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signalling pathway’ (highlighted in green) or 
‘catabolic process’ are underrepresented in the list, which implicates the importance of a putative role 
of crotonase in the inhibition of apoptosis. The bottom part of the table shows the first 15 biological 
process terms from the results of the GO enrichment analysis of the nuclear subset of the first-
neighbours of MPS1. The analysis showed that beside the known functions, such as ’cell cycle 
process’ (highlighted in green) and related terms, biological processes in connection with the proposed 
functions in nuclear assembly also occurred significantly, such as ‘cellular component organization’ 
(highlighted in yellow) and related terms. The two example proteins show the usefulness of ComPPI to 
predict new biological functions of various proteins, and to understand their role in cellular functions 
better.
