Abstract 
The development of new technology such as wearables 
that record high-quality single channel ECG, provides an 
opportunity for ECG screening in a larger population, 
especially for atrial fibrillation screening. The main goal 
of this study is to develop an automatic classification 
algorithm for normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial 
fibrillation (AF), other rhythms (O), and noise from a 
single channel short ECG segment (9-60 seconds). For this 
purpose, signal quality index (SQI) along with dense 
convolutional 
neural 
networks 
was 
used. 
Two 
convolutional neural network (CNN) models (main model 
that accepts 15 seconds ECG and secondary model that 
processes 9 seconds shorter ECG) were trained using the 
training data set. If the recording is determined to be of 
low quality by SQI, it is immediately classified as noisy. 
Otherwise, it is transformed to a time-frequency 
representation and classified with the CNN as NSR, AF, O, 
or noise. At the final step, a feature-based post-processing 
algorithm classifies the rhythm as either NSR or O in case 
the CNN model’s discrimination between the two is 
indeterminate.  The best result achieved at the official 
phase of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge on the blind test set 
was 0.80 (F1 for NSR, AF, and O were 0.90, 0.80, and 
0.70, respectively). 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart 
arrhythmia and its incidence in the United States alone is 
estimated to be 2.7-6.1 million people [1]. As such, AF 
screening using handheld easy-to-use devices has received 
a lot of attention in recent years. The goal of the 2017 
PhysioNet/CinC Challenge is the development of 
algorithms to classify normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, 
other rhythm (O), and noisy recordings from a short single-
channel ECG recording (9-60 seconds). In light of the 
successful utilization of deep neural networks for 
                                                          
* Authors contributed equally 
classification of biomedical time series (e.g., heart sounds) 
[2-5], a signal quality index (SQI) technique along with 
dense convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained with 
spectrogram representations were used for classification of 
ECG recordings. 
 
2. Method and Material 
A block diagram of our proposed method is shown in 
Figure 1. Given an ECG recording, first QRS detection 
takes place, followed by signal quality analysis. If the 
recording is judged to be of low quality (further details in 
Section 2.2), it is immediately classified as noisy (noise 
detected by SQI in Figure 1). If the recording quality is 
determined to be reasonable (SQI>0.5), the ECG is 
transformed from a one-dimensional time-series to a time-
frequency representation and consecutively evaluated 
using one of two CNNs, depending on the signal recording 
length. The first model accepts as input 15-second ECG 
segments. However, if the input recording is shorter than 
15 seconds, a secondary model that processes 9-second 
ECG segments is used. 
Both models employ the  Densely Connected 
Convolutional Network (DenseNet) architecture [6]. 
Compared to a standard CNN architecture, each layer 
within a DenseNet architecture concatenates all preceding 
layer feature-maps as input. Figure 2 illustrates this 
concept, where arrows indicate reused feature-maps from 
previous layers in a five-layer dense block. 
Each DenseNet model accepts as input a spectrogram 
segment computed by consecutive Fourier transforms 
(details could be found in section 2.4). The original 
DenseNet architecture was modified to ensure batch 
normalization [7] could be performed row-wise (i.e. 
normalizing over frequency bins per batch). This 
modification resulted in networks that outperformed 
standard channel-wide batch normalization.  
If the input ECG was labelled as NSR or O by the 
DenseNet model, an additional check was performed by a 
post-processing unit (further details in Section 2.5).

2.1. Data Splitting and Augmentation 
The training set for the challenge included 8,528 single-
channel ECG recordings (NSR: 5050, AF: 738, other 
rhythm: 2456, and noisy: 284). Details about the challenge 
dataset can be found in [8]. A 5-fold stratified split was 
applied to the 8,528 ECG recordings made available by the 
challenge organizers. Stratified splitting was used to 
maintain class prevalence between the data splits. 
Recordings from four of the splits were used to construct a 
training/validation set (6821 ECG recordings) made up of 
the QRS aligned spectrogram segments. The training set 
included 80% of the above recordings. The other 20% were 
used as a validation set during model training. The 
remaining stratified split, consisting of 1,707 ECG 
recordings, was kept as an in-house test-set for assessing 
algorithm performance, independent from the blind 
challenge test dataset. 
A further 6,312 30-second ECG segments representing 
atrial fibrillation were collected from various sources 
(including ambulatory recordings from Holter monitors) 
and used to augment the training and validation sets. 
Baseline wander was removed from each AF segment and 
was up-sampled from 250 to 300 samples-per-second in 
order to match the sampling rate of the challenge dataset. 
 
2.2. QRS Detection and Signal Quality 
Assessment 
After removing baseline wander using a moving 
average filter, QRS complexes were detected using gqrs 
algorithm, publicly available in WFDB toolbox [9]. After 
aligning by the detected QRS peaks, average template 
matching correlation coefficient [10] with the threshold of 
0.5 was used as SQI to identify noisy data. This measure 
had the highest area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for discriminating between 
artefacts and arrhythmic ECG [11].  
 
2.3. Spectrogram 
For each recording, a spectrogram was constructed 
using an FFT applied on a moving window with the length 
of 75 samples and overlap of 50%. Segments with the 
length of 15 and 9 seconds were extracted from the 
spectrogram beginning at each of the detected QRS peaks. 
 
 
2.4. Dense Convolutional Neural Networks 
If the quality of ECG recording was reasonable (SQI> 
0.5) by the SQI module, rhythm classification took place 
using a dense convolutional neural network. Recordings 
processed by CNNs were classified as NSR, AF, O, as well 
as noisy. Recall that, at first, an attempt is made to use a 
CNN model that processes 15-second segments. However, 
if the input recording length is not long enough, a 
secondary model that processes 9-second segments is used. 
 
2.4.1. Main and Secondary Models 
Main model: The 15-second model is made up of 3 
dense blocks consisting total of 40 layers. Each layer 
involves applying a convolutional filter, followed by 
ReLU activation and row-wise batch normalization. A 
growth rate of 6 feature-maps was used for each layer. 
Model input dimensions were a single channel of 20 
frequency bins by 375 time segments. The first 20 
frequency bins from the computed spectrogram captures a 
frequency range of up to approximately 50 Hz. In total, the 
model consisted of 262,344 trainable parameters. 
Secondary Model: The architecture used for the 
secondary model was similar to the main model, however, 
a smaller growth rate of 4 feature-maps was used per layer. 
Model input dimensions were a single channel of 20 
frequency bins by 225 time segments, height and width. 
The lower width resulting from the shorter 9-second 
segment size. In total, the secondary model consisted of 
119,458 trainable parameters.

rate of 4 feature-maps per layer (source [6]).

2.4.2. Model Training 
Both the main and secondary models were trained as 
four class classification models using standard softmax 
cross-entropy loss. Models were typically trained for no 
more than 15 epochs. Once a model was sufficiently 
trained, in-house testing was performed on the left-out 
stratified split, as previously described. Models that 
achieved desirable performance were further trained 
before submission to the challenge server. In particular, the 
full five splits of challenge data were used to train a final 
model, where 95% of the data was used for training and the 
remaining 5% for validation. Final model training did not 
occur from scratch, but rather weights from the previously 
learned model were used to pre-initialize the dense CNN 
for continued training using the updated, full dataset. 
 
2.5. Post Processing 
If the ECG is labelled as NSR or O by the CNN and the 
probability of being NSR and O are close to each other 
(absolute difference between probability of NSR and O < 
0.4), a feature-based post-processing step is performed to 
cast the final decision. For NSR/O post-processing, an 
AdaBoost-abstain classiﬁer  [12] was trained using the 
NSR and O recordings in the in-house training set. Its 
performance was tested on the in-house test set. A total of 
437 features were extracted from five different categories 
to train the model: 
- Signal quality (2 features): average template matching 
correlation coefficient [10] and bSQI [13] based on the 
output of gqrs and Pan-Tompkins [14] QRS detection 
algorithms.  
- Frequency content (10 features): median power across 
nine frequency bands (1-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-75, 
75-90, 90-150, 5-14, and 5-50Hz) as well as ratio of 
power in 5-14Hz band to power in 5-50Hz. The power 
spectrum of the ECG record was estimated using 
discrete-time Fourier transform.  
- Beat to beat interval (11 features): number, minimum, 
maximum, and median of RR intervals, SDNN, 
RMSSD, average heart rate, and different heart rate 
asymmetry measures (PI, GI, SI) 
- ECG-based reconstructed phase space (401 features): 
normalized ECG reconstructed phase space (RPS) was 
created with dimension 2 and delay equal to 4 samples 
[15]. Then, the RPS was divided into small square areas 
(grid of 20×20). Normalized number of points in each 
square was considered a feature. In addition, spatial 
filling index was calculated [16].  
- Poincare section from ECG (13 features): using RPS 
reconstructed from ECG, as described above, 13 
different features from Poincare section with unity line 
were extracted. More details about the method and 
features can be found in [15, 17].  
2.6. Algorithm Evaluation 
Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using an 
average of three F1 values for classification of NSR, AF, 
and O (F1n, F1a, and F1o, respectively). In-house test set 
was used for algorithm evaluation independent from the 
blind challenge test dataset. Also, performance was tested 
on a random subset of blind hidden test during official 
phase and final score was created using the whole blind test 
set. 
 
3. Results 
Area under the ROC curve for AdaBoost–abstain classifier 
in NSR/O post-processing step was 0.86 on the in-house 
test set. Only 58 features were selected by the classiﬁer, the 
top 10 were from beat to beat interval (n=5), ECG-based 
reconstructed phase space (n=2), and Poincare section 
from ECG (n=3). 
The best result achieved of the proposed algorithm at the 
official phase of the challenge on the in-house test set was 
0.82 (F1 for NSR, AF, and other rhythm were 0.91, 0.80, 
and 0.76, respectively). Final result on the whole challenge 
blind test dataset was 0.80 (F1 for NSR, AF, and other 
rhythm were 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70, respectively).

4. Discussion 
This work led to the development and evaluation of 
several model types, not all of which are fully described in 
this paper. Here we discuss some of the findings of this 
effort, as well as alternative approaches investigated 
during the CinC challenge. 
 
One of the findings of this work was that for CNNs 
that process spectrograms as input, row-wise batch 
normalization (i.e. normalizing over frequency bins 
per batch) is preferable to a typical channel-wide 
application of batch normalization. This modification 
to our CNN models consistently resulted in 
considerable performance gains. 
 
Significant experimentation was performed using so 
called wide and deep networks [18], where activations 
from later convolutional layers (deep features) are 
combined with variables that capture information


## Page 4


using domain knowledge (wide features). The wide 
features that were considered included well-known 
HRV measurements (e.g. SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50), 
entropy measure (e.g. SampleEn) and morphological 
features (e.g. P-wave duration, PR interval, QT-
interval). However, the addition of wide features 
typically resulted in approximately a 2% drop in 
overall performance. It is possible that additional wide 
features, 
not 
presently 
included 
within 
our 
experimentation, 
would 
result 
in 
performance 
improvement. 
 
Lastly, the model presented here achieved its current 
performance using only time-frequency inputs 
encoded as spectrograms. A further model type was 
tested that accepted time-frequency inputs (as 
described), as well as a parallel CNN architecture that 
accepted the raw ECG waveform as input to 
automatically capture morphological information. 
These two parallel models were combined to make a 
final classification. This dual network that captured 
frequency and morphology information showed 
promise on our in-house test set results – producing F1 
scores 
that 
outperformed 
all 
other 
network 
architectures that were evaluated. However, these 
networks resulted in computational requirements that 
were beyond the restrictions imposed by the challenge 
server, hence we were not able to assess their overall 
performance on the hidden challenge test dataset. 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
In this article, a SQI technique was combined with 
dense convolutional neural networks following by a post-
processing feature-based classifier to find the best method 
for distinguishing atrial fibrillation from normal sinus 
rhythm, other rhythms, and noise. The promising 
performance of the algorithm makes us hopeful that with 
further enhancement this technique may be suitable for 
practical clinical use.
