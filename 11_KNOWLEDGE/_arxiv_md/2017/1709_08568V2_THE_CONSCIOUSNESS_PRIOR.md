The Consciousness Prior

First posted October 15th 2017; revised, December 1, 2019
Abstract
A new prior is proposed for learning representations of high-level concepts of the kind we manipulate
with language. This prior can be combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors
from each other. It is inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, seen as a bottleneck
through which just a few elements, after having been selected by attention from a broader pool, are then
broadcast and condition further processing, both in perception and decision-making. The set of recently
selected elements one becomes aware of is seen as forming a low-dimensional conscious state. This con-
scious state is combining the few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately
conscious of at a particular moment. We claim that this architectural and information-processing con-
straint corresponds to assumptions about the joint distribution between high-level concepts. To the extent
that these assumptions are generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with them),
they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A low-dimensional thought or conscious state
is analogous to a sentence: it involves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high
probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over high-level concepts) which
has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where the dependencies captured by each factor of the factor
graph involve only very few variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function. Instead
of making predictions in the sensory (e.g. pixel) space, one can thus make predictions in this high-level
abstract space, which do not have to be limited to just the next time step but can relate events far away
from each other in time. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natu-
ral language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to facts and rules, albeit
capturing uncertainty as well as efﬁcient search mechanisms implemented by attention mechanisms.

Introduction
We propose here a new kind of prior for top-level abstract representations of concepts of the kind hu-
mans manipulate with natural language, inspired by modern theories of consciousness such as the global
workspace theory [Baars, 1988, 1997, 2002, Dehaene and Naccache, 2001, Dehaene et al., 2017] as a
form of awareness [van Gulick, 2004], i.e., as deﬁned by Locke, consciousness is “the perception of what
passes in a man’s own mind”, or awareness of an external object or something within oneself (Wikipedia
deﬁnition). The main contribution of this paper is proposing a machine learning justiﬁcation for an as-
pect of this theory, stipulating that elements of a conscious thought are selected through an attention
mechanism (such as the content-based attention mechanism we introduced in [Bahdanau et al., 2015])
and then broadcast to the rest of the brain, strongly inﬂuencing downstream perception and action as well
as the content of the next conscious thought. The paper sees this as a computational mechanism which is
consistent with a hypothesis about the form of the joint distribution between the type of high-level vari-
ables which can form a conscious thought. Since a conscious thought only refers to very few variables
at a time, we suggest that this corresponds to a form of knowledge representation which is factored into
pieces involving a few variables at a time. From a probabilistic modeling point of view, this corresponds
to a sparse factor graph. Each “factor" captures the possibly strong dependency between a few variables.
Although a variable can participate in many such factors, each factor links very few variables, similarly
to words or concepts linked together in a sentence in natural language.

System 2 Processing and Global Workspace Theory of Con-
sciousness
For lack of a generally accepted deﬁnition of consciousness - because there are still many competing the-
ories - we consider conscious aspects of cognition as those which humans can report about through lan-
guage. We closely associate conscious processing to Kahneman’s system 2 cognitive abilities [Kahneman,
2011]. System 1 tasks align well with the current successful applications of deep learning, e.g., low-level
perception (and to a lesser extent low-level action) and intuitive knowledge (e.g. knowing that a particular
Go move is good or that a given picture contains the image of a dog), i.e., knowledge which is difﬁcult
to verbalize, and which can typically be applied very quickly (in less than a second). On the other hand,
system 2 cognitive abilities are those which can can be described verbally, and thus includes the part
of our cognitive abilities which we can communicate explicitly to a computer (typically as a sequence of
computational steps), and include things like reasoning, planning and imagination. Typical system 2 tasks
require a sequence of conscious steps, which also means that they tend to take more time than system 1
tasks. By this deﬁnition, system 2 abilities are closely related to consciousness.
Cognitive neuroscience has been investigating consciousness for several decades and a dominant fam-
ily of theories on which this paper is anchored are those based on the Global Workspace Theory [Baars,
1988, 1997, 2002, Dehaene and Naccache, 2001, Dehaene et al., 2017]. This theory posits that we be-
come aware of speciﬁc pieces of information which will momentarily form the content of working mem-
ory. A conscious thought is thus a set of these elements of which we have become aware, joined together
and made globally available to other computational processes taking place in the brain at an unconscious
level. Consciousness thus provides a form of bottleneck for information which has a strong inﬂuence on
decision-making (voluntary action), memory (we tend to very quickly forget what we have not been con-
sciously aware of) and perception (we may be blind to elements of our sensory input which may distract
us from the current focus of conscious attention).
There are other aspects of consciousness which the global workspace theory does not directly address,
such as the notion of self and that of subjective perception, and we do not study them here. Instead, we
are interested in the use of machine learning ideas and experiments as ways to formalize theories of
consciousness (particularly the global workspace theory), identify advantages which they can bring to a
learning agent (e.g. as a useful prior for speciﬁc aspects of the world), and as a way to test these theories
via machine learning experiments measuring for example their effect on sample efﬁciency (or the speed
of learning) and out-of-distribution generalization.
3
Consciousness Prior Theory
We explain a machine learning framework for these ideas in more detail below, and place them in the
context of a learning agent with goals (see Sutton and Barto [1998] for basic notions of reinforcement
learning).
3.1
Extracting a Conscious State
Let xt be the observation at time t for a learning agent, and let ht be the high-level representation derived
from xt (and from past observed values {xt−k} in the partially observable case). For example, ht could be
the output of some kind of recurrent neural network (or RNN, with whatever architecture is appropriate)
that reads the sequence of xt as input and produces an output ht at each time step:
ht = F(xt, ht−1)
(1)
where we call F the representation RNN or encoder and ht the unconscious representation state. We
can think of ht as a very large vector or as a set containing all the possible elements which could be
brought to consciousness via an attention mechanism.
A core objective for the learner is to learn good representations in ht, which disentangles abstract
explanatory factors, in the sense that there exist a simple transformation of ht which can select the in-
formation about a single factor (its value or uncertainty about it). With ht seen as a set, we can think
of each element e ∈ht as one of the variables over which the learner needs to form a joint distribution
in order to make sense of the high-level dependencies. These dependencies do not have to be limited to
those between elements in the same ht: they could also relate elements arising at different time steps.
In contrast, we will deﬁne the conscious state ct as a very low-dimensional set which is derived from
ht by a form of attention mechanism applied on ht, taking into account the previous conscious state and

memory as context:
ct = C(ht, ct−1, mt−1, zt)
(2)
where zt is a random noise source and mt is the content of memory at time t. The memory content gets
updated by possibly committing ct to memory:
mt = M(mt−1, ct).
(3)
We do not explicitly put them in the notation but a realistic agent would also have goals as part of the
context which conditions both the selection of unconscious items (in F) and the update of the conscious
state (in C), then seen as a search mechanism. Also, although we do not explore the architecture of
memory mechanisms very much here, it is clear that different kinds of memory mechanisms exist in the
brain, starting with short-term memory from which very recently accessed conscious elements can be
retrieved, as well as longer-term memory, which contains a subset of the elements stored in short-term
memory. The cognitive interpretation of the above equations is that the value of ct is a set of consciously
accessed elements and corresponds to the content of a thought one is conscious of at time t. The conscious
state ct is a very small subset of all the information available to us unconsciously, ht, but which has been
brought to our awareness by a particular form of attention which picks several elements or projections
from ht. The function C is the consciousness process and because of its random noise inputs, produces
a random choice of the elements on which the attention gets focused. This is useful if we think of
the consciousness process as a tool for exploring interpretations or plans or to sample predictions about
the future or simply imagined scenarios. We can also think of the consciousness process as the tool to
make a series of associations forming a coherent argument (for reasoning). It isolates particular high-level
abstractions and extracts the information about each of them (some identifying information and attributes,
a value, and uncertainty about it or even the fact that it is observed or not). This would happen if we think
about a single factor, but in general C will aggregate a few (e.g. a handful) of such factors into a more
complex and composed thought.
3.2
Sparse Factor Graphs
A factor graph is a way to represent the joint distribution between a set of variables. Let S = {V1, . . . Vn}
be that set and P(S) be their joint distribution. In a factor graph, the joint is represented as a product of
potential functions fj, each of which only depends on a subset Sj ⊂S:
P(S) =
Q
j fj(Sj)
Z
(4)
where Z is a normalization constant. We call each fj a factor and it creates a direct dependency between
the variables in Sj. Indirect dependencies exist between variables by following paths in the bipartite
graph formed on one hand with the variables Vk and the factors fj (each associated with a subset Sj of
variables).
Translated in probabilistic terms, the consciousness prior amounts to the assumption that the factor
graph for the joint distribution between the elements in the set ht (or more generally for the set containing
all of the elements in mt and all those one could think of in the future) is sparse1. This is because the
cardinality of all Sj’s is small. The motivation for this assumption comes from observing the structure
of natural language (broken down into phrases, statements or sentences, each of which involves very
few words) as well as the structure of formal knowledge representations such as the sets of facts and
rules studied in classical symbolic / logic AI or in ontologies and knowledge graphs [Ehrlinger and Wöß,
2016]. In addition to being sparse, we believe that a related assumption can be made: most factors in
the graph describe a strong dependency, i.e., one which makes low-entropy predictions (e.g. about some
of the variables in Sj given the others). Since factor graphs are also generally understood as energy-
based models (the logarithm of each potential function contributes an additive term in the energy function
corresponding to the overall joint distribution), we can also say that each potential function creates a
strong dip in the energy function. Otherwise, they would not be worth putting in the factor graph. This
is related to the fact that we should think of this joint distribution as a very rough approximation of the
world built by learning agents to help them plan, reason, imagine, etc.
An important purpose for the consciousness prior, from a machine learning point of view, is that it
should help a learner discover an encoder which captures the kind of high-level variables which humans
talk about when they communicate with language, since natural language statements naturally tend to
1and we probably do not want to represent that graph explicitly, and instead use conscious attention to selectively traverse and
explore only relevant parts of it, in the context of given goals

satisfy both the sparsity requirement (each sentence involves few words) and the "strong dip" requirement
(otherwise the statement is not worth communicating). In the quest to discover encoding functions which
disentangle [Bengio, 2009, Bengio et al., 2013] high-level concepts from each other, we should see the
consciousness prior as one of many tools to constrain the learner towards better high-level representa-
tions. Please note in passing that by “disentangled" we do not generally mean marginally independent
(that would make all the top-level variables independent of each other), as in recent work on variational
autoencoders [Higgins et al., 2017]. Indeed, notice how natural language concepts (like say "fork" and
"knife") tend to not be independent of each other, but instead may be combined to form probable state-
ments (like "she was eating with her knife and fork").
The analogy with natural language and with knowledge graphs, ontologies and formal declarative
knowledge also suggests that new potential functions can be created as needed. Instead of having a large
but ﬁxed set of potential functions, what we have are mechanisms for creating new ones which "make
sense" according to observations, reasoning, or imagination. Instead of enumerating all the possible
potential functions, the brain may have the ability to instantiate new ones on the ﬂy. This connects the
previous section, which was about the attention mechanisms for selecting a small set of variables forming
a conscious thought (ct) with the topic of this section, which is about the declarative knowledge formed
by the set of potential functions each linking a few variables together. Whereas the sparse factor graph
constraint is about the underlying beliefs about the world (when expressed with the high-level variables),
the attention mechanisms used to build conscious thoughts are part of the inference mechanisms used to
compute efﬁciently according to the consciousness prior.
3.3
Training Objectives
To capture the assumption that a conscious thought can encapsulate a statement about the future, we could
introduce a veriﬁer network which can match a current representation state ht with a past conscious state
ct−k stored in memory mt−1:
V (ht, ct−k) ∈R
(5)
which should be structured so that V (ht, ct−k) indicates the consistency of ct−k with ht, e.g., estimating
the probability of the corresponding statement being true, given ht.
More generally, we would like to deﬁne an objective (or reward) function which embodies the idea
that the attended (conscious) elements are useful, in a way which can be quantiﬁed and optimized, i.e., that
the representation RNN and the attention mechanism which extracts ct from ht are trained to optimize
this objective function. This can be in addition to other objectives such as being able to reconstruct the
raw input or any other supervised, RL, or unsupervised objectives which we probably want to throw in.
There are two distinct mechanisms at play which contribute to map the high-level state representation
to the objective function: (1) the attention mechanism (e.g. the consciousness RNN) which selects and
combines a few elements from the high-level state representation into a low-dimensional “conscious sub-
state” object (the current content of our consciousness), and (2) the predictions or actions which are
derived from the sequence of these conscious sub-states. The second mechanism is easy to grasp and
frame in standard ML practice, either in deep learning or RL, e.g. for supervised or unsupervised or RL
tasks. For example, the attention mechanism could select elements B from the current representation state
and choose to make a prediction about future elements A. Then to improve the quality of the prediction
mechanism we may just want to maximize logP(A|B) or some proxy for it, e.g., using a variational
auto-encoder [Kingma and Welling, 2014] objective or a a conditional GAN [Mirza and Osindero, 2014]
if one wants to sample accurately an A from B. Note again that such an objective function is not just
used to learn the mapping from B to A (or to probabilities over the space of A values), but also drives
the learning of the representation function itself, i.e., is back-propagated into the representation RNN).
However, this part of the objective function (e.g. predictive value, computed by V above) is not sufﬁcient
and in fact is not appropriate to train the attention mechanism itself (which variables A and B should be
selected?). Indeed, if that was the driving objective for attention, the learner would always pick a pair
(A, B) such that A is trivially predictable from B (and there are such aspects of reality which are trivially
predictable yet do not help us to further understand the world and make sense of it or achieve our goals).
It remains an open question what other objectives would be appropriate for learning how to attend to the
most useful elements, but ultimately we should be able to use the actual RL reward of the learning agent
using ct for taking decisions. Some form of mutual information, entropy or diversity may be needed so
that the attention mechanism is stochastic and can choose a very diverse set of possible attended elements,
so as to cover widely the possible variables A on which a prediction is made, i.e., the entropy of (A, B)
pairs.

3.4
Naming Variables and Indirection
Content-based soft-attention or hard-attention mechanisms [Bahdanau et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015] ex-
tract a value from a set of element by taking a convex weighted sum of values from an input set of values.
Those weights are the attention weights and they are computed by an attention mechanism which gives a
larger weight on the element with the most appropriate "key", according to some context.
In standard neural networks without attention, a neuron i is identiﬁed by its position in its layer and
the signal it sends to some other neuron j downstream does not need to be identiﬁed as coming from i.
However, when attention mechanisms such as described above are used to provide an input value to j,
the input could come from any of the elements over which attention is making a selection. Depending
on the computation performed, it could thus be useful for downstream layers with attention mechanisms
selecting their input to receive not just the weighted (selected) value but also information about the source
of the information. We can think of that information as a variable name (and possibly other attributes
which we can interpret as variable type), which complement the variable value. The idea of (key,value)
pairs was used in memory augmented neural networks [Graves et al., 2014, Weston et al., 2014], although
it is not clear if a distinction between keys and values exists in the brain, or if a general auto-associative
mechanism is used instead.
When elements from the unconscious state ht are selected to enter the conscious state ct using content-
based soft-attention [Bahdanau et al., 2015], it is not just a value which should be copied but also some
"key" which identiﬁes the origin of that value. Modern attention-based deep learning architectures such
as Transformers [Vaswani et al., 2017] bind (key,value) pairs together precisely for that purpose. For
example, the kind of veriﬁer network discussed above needs to associate a (key,prediction) pair made
in the past with a (key,realization) pair observed later. The key thus acts like a name and provides a
form of indirection or reference. If the key and value were mixed up and the predicted value differs
substantially from the observed value, a simple associative process might miss the opportunity to match
these and thus provide a strong training signal (to correct the predictor). Another reason to represent
keys separately from values is that the keys can be used to represent a form of type information, to help
match the expected argument type of a downstream computation with an appropriate element selected by
an attention mechanism. This is important in order to obtain systematic generalization [Lake and Baroni,
2017] and combinatorial properties omnipresent in natural language, making it easier to combine different
pieces of neural hardware together dynamically, with keys being used to decide which information should
be routed where. We could thus see the conscious state as a bottleneck to route such information across
many different modules.
3.5
Connection to Language and Symbolic Knowledge Representation
We hypothesize that conscious processing of the kind described above could thus help the brain (and
future machine learning systems) achieve better systematic generalization and combine concepts in ﬂuent
and combinatorial ways. The fact that we deﬁne consciousness in terms of verbal reporting may be
important to note here. All this indeed suggests that there is a fairly simple transformation of conscious
states into natural language sentences. Conversely, an externally provided sentence (heard or read) could
also elicit an associated conscious state, although we postulate that the conscious state is generally a richer
object than the uttered sentence, i.e., mapping from conscious states to sentences loses information (think
about visual imagery, or artistic expression, which are difﬁcult to put in words), and the same sentence
could thus be interpreted differently depending on context and the particulars of the agent who reads that
sentence. Formally, we could use another RNN to map a conscious state to an utterance ut:
ut = U(ct, ut−1).
(6)
A learning agent which uses language could thus beneﬁt from an additional regularization effect putting
pressure on the encoder: the set of currently consciously attended elements should have a direct two-
way mapping with natural language utterances which may be uttered by other agents, such as a human
teacher. This would act as a weak form of supervision for the concepts produced by the encoder. A
sentence focuses on just a handful of elements and concepts, unlike our full internal state. This imposes
soft constraints on the representation function in that its individual elements or dimensions are more likely
to correspond to concepts which can typically be expressed by a single word or phrase. Based on these
arguments, it is reasonable to hypothesize that language may actually help humans build sharper internal
representations (which are better disentangled) as well as facilitate learning – see the arguments around
curriculum learning [Bengio et al., 2009] and cultural learning [Bengio, 2014] – and enable collaborative
task-solving.
Along the same line, this research opens the door to the possibility of better connecting deep learn-
ing with classical symbolic AI and cognitive science, and move deep learning from perception (where
5


## Page 6


it currently shines) to higher-level cognition and knowledge representation (where many questions re-
main open). For example, declarative knowledge is classically represented by facts and rules: each of
them is a very sharp statement (true with high probability) about reality involving just a few concepts.
Such a nugget of information or knowledge seems to ﬁt well as a conscious state. Combining such
conscious states sequentially in order to make more complex predictions and inferences or actions is ba-
sically what reasoning is about. However, pasting symbolic logic computations on top of a deep learning
encoder might not succeed for several reasons. This would lose the ability manipulate uncertainty as
well as represent the context-dependent effect of goals and background knowledge which deep learning
with content-based attention can provide, in addition to the ability to improve generalization through
distributed representations. Instead, we envision extensions of deep learning based on attention that im-
plement conscious processing functionalities associated with system 2 tasks in humans. Progress in this
direction would also address the often expressed concern about obtaining explanations from deep nets,
since the approach proposed here would make it easier for a trained agent to communicate verbally its
high-level state.

Considerations for Experimenting with the Consciousness
Prior
Because this is a novel theory which may be developped in many different ways, it is important to start
with simple toy experiments allowing one to test and evaluate qualitatively different approaches, such that
the turnaround time for each experiment is very short and the analysis of the representations learned very
easy (because we already have a preconceived idea of what concepts would be the most appropriate to
disentangle).
Although working with natural language input would be likely to help the agent learn better and more
abstract representations, it might be better to start with experiments with no linguistic input, to make sure
that it is the training objective and the training framework alone which are leading to the discovery of the
appropriate high-level concepts. For example, learning some form of intuitive physics is done by babies
without the need for linguistic guidance. Similarly, although the consciousness prior could be used in
supervised learning or task-oriented RL, testing its ability alone to discover high-level abstractions would
be best done in the context of unsupervised RL, e.g., using an intrinsic reward which favours the discovery
of how the environment works.
It would be more interesting for the learning task to involve meaningful abstractions which have a high
predictive power. For example, consider predicting whether a pile of blocks will fall on or off a table. It
involves a high-level discrete outcome which can be predicted easily, even if the details of where the
blocks will fall is very difﬁcult even for humans to predict. In that case, predicting the future at the pixel
level would be extremely difﬁcult because future states have high entropy, with a highly multi-modal
distribution. However, some aspects of the future may have low entropy. If in addition, these aspects
have a big impact on predicting what will come next (or on taking the right decisions now), then the
consciousness prior should be very useful.
