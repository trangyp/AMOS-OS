Abstract
This paper presents an empirical com-
parison of two strategies for Vietnamese
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging from unseg-
mented text: (i) a pipeline strategy where
we consider the output of a word seg-
menter as the input of a POS tagger, and
(ii) a joint strategy where we predict a
combined segmentation and POS tag for
each syllable. We also make a comparison
between state-of-the-art (SOTA) feature-
based and neural network-based models.
On the benchmark Vietnamese treebank
(Nguyen et al., 2009), experimental results
show that the pipeline strategy produces
better scores of POS tagging from unseg-
mented text than the joint strategy, and the
highest accuracy is obtained by using a
feature-based model.
1
Introduction
POS tagging is one of the most fundamental nat-
ural language processing (NLP) tasks. In English
where white space is a strong indicator of word
boundaries, POS tagging is an important first step
towards many other NLP tasks. However, white
space when written in Vietnamese is also used
to separate syllables that constitute words. So for
Vietnamese NLP, word segmentation is referred to
as the key first step (Dien et al., 2001).
When applying POS tagging to real-world Viet-
namese text where gold word-segmentation is not
available, the pipeline strategy is to first segment
the text by using a word segmenter, and then
feed the word-segmented text—which is the out-
put of the word segmenter—as the input to a POS
tagger. For example, given a written text “thuế
thu nhập cá nhân” (individualcá_nhân incomethu_nhập
taxthuế) consisting of 5 syllables, the word seg-
menter returns a two-word phrase “thuế_thu_nhập
cá_nhân.”1 Then given the input segmented text
“thuế_thu_nhập cá_nhân”, the POS tagger returns
“thuế_thu_nhập/N cá_nhân/N.”
A class of approaches to POS tagging from un-
segmented text that has been actively explored in
other languages, such as in Chinese and Japanese,
is joint word segmentation and POS tagging
(Zhang and Clark, 2008). A possible joint strat-
egy is to assign a combined segmentation and POS
tag to each syllable (Kruengkrai et al., 2009). For
example, given the input text “thuếthu nhập cá
nhân”, the joint strategy would produce “thuế/B-
N thu/I-N nhập/I-N cá/B-N nhân/I-N”, where B
refers to the beginning of a word and I refers to
the inside of a word. Shao et al. (2017) showed
that this joint strategy gives SOTA results for Chi-
nese POS tagging by utilizing a BiLSTM-CNN-
CRF model (Ma and Hovy, 2016).
In this paper, we present the first empirical
study comparing the joint and pipeline strate-
gies for Vietnamese POS tagging from unseg-
mented text. In addition, we make a comparison
between SOTA feature-based and neural network-
based models, which, to the best of our knowledge,
has not done in any prior work on Vietnamese.
On the benchmark Vietnamese treebank (Nguyen
et al., 2009), we show that the pipeline strategy
produces better scores than the joint strategy. We
also show that the highest tagging accuracy is ob-
tained by using a traditional feature-based model
rather than neural network-based models.

Tran et al. (2010) considered the Vietnamese word
segmentation task as a sequence labeling task, us-
ing either a CRF, SVM or MaxEnt model to as-
sign each syllable a segmentation tag such as B
or I. In addition, Le et al. (2008), Pham et al.
(2009) and Tran et al. (2012) used the maximum
matching method (NanYuan and YanBin, 1991) to
generate all possible segmentations for each in-
put sentence; then to select the best segmentation,
Le et al. (2008) and Tran et al. (2012) applied n-
gram language model while Pham et al. (2009)
employed POS information from an external POS
tagger. Later, Liu and Lin (2014) and Nguyen and
Le (2016) proposed approaches based on point-
wise prediction, where a binary classifier is trained
to identify whether or not there is a word bound-
ary at each point between two syllables. Further-
more, Nguyen et al. (2017b) proposed a rule-based
approach which gets the highest results to date in
terms of both segmentation accuracy and speed.
2.2
POS tagging
Regarding Vietnamese POS tagging, Dien and
Kiem (2003) projected POS annotations from En-
glish to Vietnamese via a bilingual corpus of word
alignments. As a standard sequence labeling task,
previous research has applied the CRF, SVM or
MaxEnt model to assign each word a POS tag
(Nghiem et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2009; Le-Hong
et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010; Tran et al.,
2010; Bach et al., 2013). In addition, Nguyen et al.
(2011) proposed a rule-based approach to auto-
matically construct transformation rules for POS
tagging in the form of a Ripple Down Rules tree
(Compton and Jansen, 1990), leading to a devel-
opment of the RDRPOSTagger (Nguyen et al.,
2014a) which was the best system for the POS tag-
ging shared task at the 2013 Vietnamese Language
and Speech Processing (VLSP) workshop.
Nguyen et al. (2016a) and Nguyen et al. (2016b)
later showed that SOTA accuracies at 94+% in
the Vietnamese POS tagging task are obtained by
simply retraining existing English POS taggers on
Vietnamese data, showing that the MarMoT tagger
(Mueller et al., 2013) and the Stanford POS tagger
(Toutanova et al., 2003) obtain higher accuracies
than RDRPOSTagger. Nguyen et al. (2016a) also
showed that a simple lexicon-based approach as-
signing each word by its most probable POS tag
gains a promising accuracy at 91%. Note that both
Nguyen et al. (2016a) and Nguyen et al. (2016b)
did not experiment with neural network models.
Pham et al. (2017) recently applied the BiLSTM-
CNN-CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016) for Vietnamese
POS tagging, however, they did not experiment
with SOTA feature-based models.
Previously, only Takahashi and Yamamoto
(2016) carried out joint word segmentation and
POS tagging for Vietnamese, to predicting a com-
bined segmentation and POS tag to each sylla-
ble. In particular, Takahashi and Yamamoto (2016)
experimented with traditional SVM- and CRF-
based toolkits on a dataset of about 7k sentences
and reported results of joint prediction only, i.e.,
they did not compare to the pipeline strategy. The
CoNLL 2017 shared task on Universal Dependen-
cies (UD) parsing from raw text (Zeman et al.,
2017) provided some results to the pipeline strat-
egy from word segmentation to POS tagging, how-
ever, the Vietnamese dataset in the UD project
is very small, consisting of 1,400 training sen-
tences. Furthermore, Nguyen et al. (2017a) pro-
vided a pre-trained jPTDP model for joint POS
tagging and dependency parsing for Vietnamese,2
which obtains a tagging accuracy at 93.0%, a UAS
score at 77.7% and a LAS score at 69.5% when
evaluated on the Vietnamese dependency treebank
VnDT of 10k sentences (Nguyen et al., 2014b).

Experimental methodology
We compare the joint word segmentation and POS
tagging strategy to the pipeline strategy on the
benchmark Vietnamese treebank (Nguyen et al.,
2009) using well-known POS tagging models.
3.1
Joint segmentation and POS tagging
Following Kruengkrai et al. (2009), Takahashi and
Yamamoto (2016) and Shao et al. (2017), we for-
malize the joint word segmentation and POS tag-
ging problem for Vietnamese as a sequence la-
beling task to assigning a combined segmenta-
tion and POS tag to each syllable. For exam-
ple, given a manually POS-annotated training cor-
pus “Cuộc/Nc điều_tra/V dường_như/X không/R
tiến_triển/V ./CH” ‘The investigation seems to
be making no progress’, we transform this cor-
pus into a syllable-based representation as follows:
“Cuộc/B-Nc điều/B-V tra/I-V dường/B-X như/I-X
không/B-R tiến/B-V triển/I-V ./B-CH”, where seg-
mentation tags B and I denote beginning and in-

side of a word, respectively, while Nc, V, X, R and
CH are POS tags. Then we train sequence labeling
models on the syllable-based transformed corpus.
3.2
Dataset
The Vietnamese treebank (Nguyen et al., 2009) is
the largest annotated corpus for Vietnamese, pro-
viding a set of 27,870 manually POS-annotated
sentences for training and development (about 23
words per sentence on average) and a test set of
2120 manually POS-annotated sentences (about
31 words per sentence).3 From the set of 27,870
sentences, we use the first 27k sentences for train-
ing and the last 870 sentences for development.
3.3
Models
For both joint and pipeline strategies, we use the
following models:
• RDRPOSTagger (Nguyen et al., 2014a) is
a transformation rule-based learning model
which obtained the highest accuracy at the
VLSP 2013 POS tagging shared task.4
• MarMoT (Mueller et al., 2013) is a generic
CRF framework and a SOTA POS and mor-
phological tagger.5
• BiLSTM-CRF (Huang et al., 2015) is a se-
quence labeling model which extends the
BiLSTM model with a CRF layer.
• BiLSTM-CRF + CNN-char, i.e. BiLSTM-
CNN-CRF, is an extension of the BiLSTM-
CRF, using CNN to derive character-based
representations (Ma and Hovy, 2016).
• BiLSTM-CRF + LSTM-char is another ex-
tension of the BiLSTM-CRF, using BiLSTM
to derive the character-based representations
(Lample et al., 2016).
Here, for the pipeline strategy, we train these
models to predict POS tags with respect to (w.r.t.)
gold word segmentation. In addition, we also re-
train the fast and accurate Vietnamese word seg-
menter RDRsegmenter (Nguyen et al., 2017b) us-
ing the training set of 27k sentences.6
3The data was officially used for the Vietnamese POS tag-
ging shared task at the second VLSP 2013 workshop.

Implementation details
We use the original pure Java implementations of
RDRPOSTagger and MarMoT with default hyper-
parameter settings in our experiments. Instead of
using implementations independently provided by
authors of BiLSTM-CRF, BiLSTM-CRF + CNN-
char7 and BiLSTM-CRF + LSTM-char, we use
a reimplementation which is optimized for per-
formance of all these models from Reimers and
Gurevych (2017).8
For three BiLSTM-CRF-based models, we use
default hyper-parameters provided by Reimers and
Gurevych (2017) with the following exceptions:
we use a dropout rate at 0.5 (Ma and Hovy, 2016)
with the frequency threshold of 5 for unknown
word and syllable types. We initialize word and
syllable embeddings with 100-dimensional pre-
trained embeddings,9 then learn them together
with other model parameters during training by us-
ing Nadam (Dozat, 2016). For training, we run for
100 epochs. We perform a grid search of hyper-
parameters to select the number of BiLSTM lay-
ers from {1, 2, 3} and the number of LSTM units
in each layer from {50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300}.
Early stopping is applied when no performance
improvement on the development set is obtained
after 5 contiguous epochs. For both pipeline and
joint strategies, we find the highest performance
on the development set is when using two stacked
BiLSTM layers. Table 1 presents the optimal num-
ber of LSTM units.
Here the performance is evaluated by F1 score,
based on the number of correctly segmented and
tagged words (Zhang and Clark, 2008). In the case
of gold word segmentation, F1 score for POS tag-
ging is in fact the tagging accuracy.

Main results
Table 2 presents POS tagging accuracy and tag-
ging speed of each model on the test set w.r.t.
gold word segmentation, in which MarMoT is
the most accurate model while RDRPOSTagger
is the fastest one. In particular, MarMoT obtains
0.5%+ higher accuracy than the three BiLSTM-
based models. This is not surprising as the training
set of 27k sentences is relatively small compared
to the training data available in other languages
such as English or Chinese.
Table 3 presents F1 scores for word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging in a real-world application
scenario where the gold word-segmentation is not
available. Comparing the results in Table 2 to re-
sults for the pipeline strategy, we observe a drop
of about 2% for all models when using predicted
segmentation instead of gold segmentation. Also,
Table 3 clearly shows that the pipeline strategy
helps produce better results than the joint strategy.
In addition, pre-designed features in both RDR-
POSTagger and MarMoT are designed to capture
word-level information rather than syllable-level
information, so it is also not surprising that for
the joint strategy RDRPOSTagger is significantly
lower while MarMoT is lower than the BiLSTM-
CRF model with additional character-based repre-
sentations.
Tables 2 and 3 suggest that for a practical ap-
plication to Vietnamese where performance accu-
racy is preferred, we should consider using the
pipeline strategy with a traditional SOTA feature-
based tagger such as MarMoT. If speed is preferred
such as in big data, RDRPOSTagger would be a
superior alternative. With the current state of train-
ing data available in Vietnamese, future research
should focus on incorporating Vietnamese linguis-

Conclusion
We have presented empirical comparisons be-
tween two strategies for Vietnamese POS tag-
ging from unsegmented text and between SOTA
feature- and neural network-based models. Ex-
perimental results on the benchmark Vietnamese
treebank (Nguyen et al., 2009) show that the
pipeline strategy produces higher scores of POS
tagging from unsegmented text than the joint strat-
egy. In addition, we also show that a traditional
feature-based model (i.e. MarMoT) obtains bet-
ter POS tagging accuracy than neural network-
based models. We provide a pre-trained MarMoT
model for Vietnamese POS tagging at https://
github.com/datquocnguyen/VnMarMoT.
