Abstract—Semantic role labelling (SRL) is a task in natural
language processing which detects and classifies the semantic
arguments associated with the predicates of a sentence. It is
an important step towards understanding the meaning of a
natural language. There exists SRL systems for well-studied
languages like English, Chinese or Japanese but there is not
any such system for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we
present the first SRL system for Vietnamese with encouraging
accuracy. We first demonstrate that a simple application of
SRL techniques developed for English could not give a good
accuracy for Vietnamese. We then introduce a new algorithm
for extracting candidate syntactic constituents, which is much
more accurate than the common node-mapping algorithm usually
used in the identification step. Finally, in the classification step,
in addition to the common linguistic features, we propose novel
and useful features for use in SRL. Our SRL system achieves an
F1 score of 73.53% on the Vietnamese PropBank corpus. This
system, including software and corpus, is available as an open
source project and we believe that it is a good baseline for the
development of future Vietnamese SRL systems.

INTRODUCTION
SRL is the task of identifying semantic roles of predicates
in the sentence. In particular, it answers a question Who did
What to Whom, When, Where, Why?. A simple Vietnamese
sentence Nam giúp Huy học bài vào hôm qua (Nam helped
Huy to do homework yesterday) is given in Figure 1.
Figure 1: An example sentence

When
To assign semantic roles for the sentence above, we must
analyse and label the propositions concerning the predicate
giúp (helped) of the sentence. Figure 2 shows a result of the
SRL for this example, where meaning of the labels will be
described in detail in Section IV.

SRL has been used in many natural language processing
(NLP) applications such as question answering [1], machine
translation [2], document summarization [3] and information
extraction [4]. Therefore, SRL is an important task in NLP.
The first SRL system was developed by Gildea and Juraf-
sky [5]. This system was performed on the FrameNet corpus
and was used for English. After that, SRL task has been
widely researched by the NLP community. In particular, there
have been two shared-tasks, CoNLL-2004 [6] and CoNLL-
2005 [7], focusing on SRL task for English. Most of the
systems participating in these share-tasks treated this prob-
lem as a classification problem and applied some supervised
machine learning techniques. In addition, there were some
systems developed for other languages such as Chinese [8]
or Japanese [9].
In this paper, we present the first SRL system for Viet-
namese with encouraging accuracy. We first demonstrate that
a simple application of SRL techniques developed for En-
glish or other languages could not give a good accuracy
for Vietnamese. In particular, in the constituent identification
step, the widely used 1-1 node-mapping algorithm for extract-
ing argument candidates performs poorly on the Vietnamese
dataset, having F1 score of 35.84%. We thus introduce a
new algorithm for extracting candidates, which is much more
accurate, achieving an F1 score of 83.63%.
In the classification step, in addition to the common
linguistic features, we propose novel and useful features for use
in SRL, including function tags and word clusters obtained by
performing a Gaussian mixture analysis on the distributed rep-
resentations of Vietnamese words. These features are employed
in two statistical classification models, Maximum Entropy and
Support Vector Machines, which are proved to be good at many
classification problems.
Our SRL system achieves an F1 score of 73.53% on the
Vietnamese PropBank corpus. This system, including software
and corpus, is available as an open source project and we
believe that it is a good baseline for the development of future
Vietnamese SRL systems.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces
briefly the SRL task and two well-known corpora for English.
Section III describes the methodologies of some existing
systems and of our system. Some difficulties of SRL for Viet-
namese are also discussed. Section IV presents the evaluation
results and discussion. Finally, Section V concludes the paper
and suggests some directions for future work.

BACKGROUND
A. SRL Task Description
The SRL task is usually divided into two steps. The first
step is argument identification. The goal of this step is to


## Page 2


Figure 3: Example of identification task
Nam gi´up Huy học bài vào hôm qua
identify the syntactic constituents of a sentence which are the
most likely to be semantic arguments of its predicates. This is
a difficult problem since the number of constituent candidates
is exponentially large, especially for long sentences.
The second step is argument classification which decides
the exact semantic role for each constituent candidate identified
in the first task. For example, the identification step of the
sentence in the previous example Nam giúp Huy học bài vào
hôm qua is described in Figure 3 and in the classification task,
semantic roles are labelled as shown Figure 2.
B. Existing Corpora for SRL
1) FrameNet: The FrameNet project is a lexical database
of English. It was built by annotating examples of how words
are used in actual texts. It consists of more than 10,000 word
senses, most of them with annotated examples that show the
meaning and usage and more than 170,000 manually annotated
sentences [10]. This is the most widely used dataset upon
which SRL systems for English have been developed and
tested.
FrameNet is based on the Frame Semantics theory [11].
The basic idea is that the meanings of most words can be best
understood on the basis of a semantic frame: a description of
a type of event, relation, or entity and the participants in it.
All members in semantic frames are called frame elements.
For example, a sentence in FrameNet is annotated in cooking
concept as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: An example sentence in the FrameNet corpus

Cook
grills their catches

Heating−instrument
2) PropBank: PropBank is a corpus that is annotated with
verbal propositions and their arguments [12]. PropBank tries
to supply a general purpose labelling of semantic roles for a
large corpus to support the training of automatic semantic role
labelling systems. However, defining such a universal set of
semantic roles for all types of predicates is a difficult task;
therefore, only Arg0 and Arg1 semantic roles can be general-
ized. In addition to the core roles, PropBank defines several
adjunct roles that can apply to any verb. It is called Argument
Modifier. The semantic roles covered by the PropBank are the
following:
•
Core Arguments (Arg0-Arg5, ArgA): Arguments de-
fine predicate specific roles. Their semantics depend
on predicates in the sentence.
•
Adjunct Arguments (ArgM-): General arguments
that can belong to any predicate. There are 13 types
of adjuncts.
•
Reference Arguments (R-): Arguments represent ar-
guments realized in other parts of the sentence.

•
Predicate (V): Participant realizing the verb of the
proposition.
For example, the sentence of Figure 4 can be annotated in the
PropBank role schema as shown in Figure 5.

METHODOLOGY
A. Existing Approaches
This section summarizes existing approaches used by typi-
cal SRL systems for well-studied languages. We describe these
systems by investigating two aspects, namely data type that
the systems use and their strategies for labelling semantic
roles, including model types, labelling strategies and degrees
of granularity.
1) Data Types: There are some kinds of data used in
the training of SRL systems. Some systems use bracketed
trees as the input data. A bracketed tree of a sentence is
the tree of nested constituents representing its constituency
structure. Some systems use dependency trees of a sentence,
which represents dependencies between individual words of
a sentence. The syntactic dependency represents the fact that
the presence of a word is licensed by another word which
is its governor. In a typed dependency analysis, grammatical
labels are added to the dependencies to mark their grammatical
relations, for example nominal subject (nsubj) or direct object
(dobj). Figure 6 shows the bracketed tree and the dependency
tree of an example sentence.

2) SRL Strategy:
a) Model Types: There are two types of classification
models: Independent Model and Joint Model. While indepen-
dent model decides the label of each argument’s candidate
independently of other candidates, joint model finds the best
overall labelling for all candidates in the sentence. Independent
model runs fast but are prone to inconsistencies. For example,
Figure 7 shows some typical inconsistencies, including overlap-
ping arguments, repeating arguments and missing arguments
of a sentence Do học chăm, Nam đã đạt thành tích cao (By
studying hard, Nam got a high achievement).

(c) Missing argument
b) Labelling Stategies: Strategies for labelling semantic
roles are diverse, but we can summarize that there are three
main strategies. Most of the systems use a two-step approach
consisting of identification and classification [13], [14]. The
first step identifies arguments from many candidates. It is
essentially a binary classification problem. The second step
classifies these arguments into particular semantic roles. Some
systems use single classification step by adding a “null” label
into semantic roles, denoting that this is not an argument [15].
Other systems consider SRL as a sequence tagging [16], [17].
c) Granularity: Existing SRL systems use different
degrees of granularity when considering constituents. Some
systems use individual words as their input and perform
sequence tagging to identify arguments. This method is called
Word-by-Word (W-by-W) approach. Other systems directly
take syntactic phrases as input constituents. This method is
called Constituent-by-Constituent (C-by-C) approach.
Compared to the W-by-W approach, C-by-C approach has
several advantages. First, phrase boundaries are usually con-
sistent with argument boundaries. Second, C-by-C approach
allows us to work with larger contexts due to a smaller number
of candidates in comparison to the W-by-W approach.
B. Our Approach
The previous subsection has reviewed existing techniques
for SRL which have been published so far for well-studied
languages. In this section, we first show that these techniques
per se cannot give a good result for Vietnamese SRL, due to
some inherent difficulties, both in terms of language charac-
teristics and of the available corpus. We then develop a new
algorithm for extracting candidate constituents for use in the
identification step.
Some difficulties of Vietnamese SRL are related to its
SRL corpus. We use the Vietnamese PropBank [18] in the
development of our SRL system.1 This SRL corpus has 5,000
annotated sentences, which is much smaller than SRL corpora
of other languages. For example, the English PropBank con-
tains about 50,000 sentences, which is ten times larger. While
smaller in size, the Vietnamese PropBank has more semantic
roles than the English PropBank has – 25 roles compared to
21 roles. This makes the unavoidable data sparseness problem
more severe for Vienamese SRL than for English SRL.
In addition, our extensive inspection and experiments on
the Vietnamese PropBank have uncovered that this corpus has
many annotation errors, largely due to encoding problems and
inconsistencies in annotation. In many cases, we have to fix
these annotation errors by ourselves. In other cases where only
a proposition of a complex sentence is incorrectly annotated,
we perform an automatic preprocessing procedure to drop it
out, leave the correctly annotated propositions untouched. We
finally come up with a corpus of 4,800 sentences which are
semantic role annotated. This corpus will be released for free
use for research purpose.
A major difficulty of Vietnamese SRL is due to the nature
of the language, where its linguistic characteristics are different
from occidental languages [19]. We first try to apply the
common node-mapping algorithm which are widely used in
English SRL systems to the Vietnamese corpus. However,
this application gives us a very poor performance. Therefore,
in the identification step, we develop a new algorithm for
extracting candidate constituents which is much more accurate
for Vietnamese than the node-mapping algorithm. Details of
experimental results will be provided in the Section IV
In order to improve the accuracy of the classification step,
and hence of our SRL system as a whole, we have integrated
many useful features for use in two statistical classification
models, namely Maximum Entropy (ME) and Support Vector
Machines (SVM). On the one hand, we adapt the features
which have been proved to be good for SRL of English. On the
other hand, we propose some novel features, including function
tags and word clusters.
In the next paragraph, we present our constituent extraction
algorithm for the identification step. Details of the features for
use in the classification step will be presented in Section IV.
1) Constituent Extraction Algorithm: This algorithm aims
to extract constituents from a bracketed tree which are as-
sociated to their corresponding predicates of the sentence. If
the sentence has multiple predicates, multiple constituent sets
corresponding to the predicates are extracted. Pseudo code of
the algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.
This algorithm uses several simple functions. The root()
function gets the root of a tree. The children() function gets
the children of a node. The sibling() function gets the sisters
of a node. The isPhrase() function checks whether a node
is of phrasal type or not. The phraseT ype() function and
functionT ag() function extracts the phrase type and function
tag of a node, respectively. Finally, the collect(node) function
collects words from leaves of the subtree rooted at a node and
creates a constituent.
1To our knowledge, this is the first SRL corpus for Vietnamese which has
been published for free research.

Figure 8 shows an example of running the algorithm on
a sentence Bà nói nó là con trai tôi mà (She said that he is
my son). First, we find the current predicate node V-H là (is).
The current node has only one sibling NP. This node has one
child, so its associated words are collected. After that, we set
current node to its parent and repeat the process until reaching
the root of the tree. Finally, we obtain a tree with constituents:
Bà, nói, nó, and con trai tôi mà.
2) Our SRL System: Our SRL system is developed on
the Vietnamese PropBank. It thus operates on fully bracketed
trees. We employ ME and SVM as classifiers. Its classification
model is of type independent and its input are C-by-C.

EXPERIMENT
In this section, we first introduce the Vietnamese PropBank
upon which our SRL system has been trained and tested. We
then propose two feature sets in use. Finally, we present and
discuss experimental results.
A. Dataset
We conduct experiments on the Vietnamese PropBank [18]
containing about 5,460 sentences which are manually anno-

tated with semantic roles. This corpus has a similar annotation
schema to the English PropBank. Due to some inconsistency
annotation errors of the corpus, notably in many complex
sentences, we were not able to use all the corpus in our
experiments. We focus ourselves in simple sentences which
have only one predicate rather than complex sentences with
multiple predicates. After extracting sentences, we have a
corpus of about 4,860 simple sentences which are annotated
with semantic roles.
The semantic roles covered by the Vietnamese PropBank
are the following:
•
Core Arguments (Arg0-Arg4): Arguments define
predicate specific roles. These core arguments are
similar to those of the English PropBank, however,
there are 5 roles instead of 7, compared to the English
PropBank.
•
Adjunct Arguments (ArgM-): There are 20 types of
adjuncts, as listed in Table I.
•
Predicate (V): In Vietnamese, a predicate is not only
a verb, but it could be also a noun, an adjective or a
preposition.
B. Feature Sets
We use two feature sets in this study. The first one is
composed of basic features which are commonly used in SRL
system for English. This feature set is used in the SRL system
of Gildea and Jurafsky on the FrameNet corpus [5].

1) Basic Feature Set: This feature set consists of 6 feature
templates, as follows:
1)
Phrase Type: This is very useful feature in classi-
fying semantic roles because different roles tend to
have different syntactic categories. For example, in
the sentence in Figure 8 Bà nói nó là con trai tôi mà,
the phrase type of constituent nó is NP.
2)
Parse Tree Path: This feature captures the syntactic
relation between a constituent and a predicate in a
bracketed tree. This is the shortest path from a con-
stituent node to a predicate node in the tree. We use
either symbol ↑or symbol ↓to indicate the upward
direction or the downward direction, respectively. For
example, the parse tree path from constituent nó to
the predicate là is NP↑S↓VP↓V.
3)
Position: Position is a binary feature that describes
whether the constituent occurs after or before the
predicate. It takes value 0 if the constituent appears
before the predicate in the sentence or value 1 other-
wise. For example, the position of constituent nó in
Figure 8 is 0 since it appears before predicate là.
4)
Voice: Sometimes, the differentiation between active
and passive voice is useful. For example, in an active
sentence, the subject is usually an Arg0 while in a
passive sentence, it is often an Arg1. Voice feature is
also binary feature, taking value 1 for active voice or
0 for passive voice. The sentence in Figure 8 is of
active voice, thus its voice feature value is 1.
5)
Head Word: This is the first word of a phrase. For
example, the head word for the phrase con trai tôi mà
is con trai.
6)
Subcategorization: Subcategorization feature cap-
tures the tree that has the concerned predicate as its
child. For example, in Figure 8, the subcategorization
of the predicate là is VP(V, NP).
2) Modified Features and New Features: Preliminary in-
vestigations on the basic feature set give us a rather poor
result. Therefore, we propose some modified features and novel
features so as to improve the accuracy of the system. These
features are as follows:
1)
Function Tag: Function tag is a useful information,
especially for classifying adjunct arguments. It deter-
mines a constituent’s role, for example, the function
tag of constituent nó is SUB, indicating that this has
a subjective role.
2)
Partial Parse Tree Path: Many sentences have com-
plicated structure. It can make parse tree path very
long and infrequent. We propose to cut a path from

the lowest common ancestor to its predicate, instead
of using the full path. For example, the partial path
from the constituent nó to the predicate là in Figure 8
is NP↑S.
3)
Distance: This feature records the length of the full
parse tree path before pruning. This feature helps
retaining some information that might be lost when
a partial path, instead of a full path, is used. For
example, the distance from constituent nó to the
predicate là is 3.
4)
Predicate Type: Unlike in English, the type of pred-
icates in Vietnamese is much more complicated. It is
not only a verb, but is also a noun, an adjective, or
a preposition. Therefore, we propose a new feature
which captures predicate types. For example, the
predicate type of the concerned predicate is V.
5)
Word Cluster: Word clusters have been shown to
help improve the performance of many NLP tasks be-
cause they alleviate the severity of the data sparseness
problem. Thus, in this work we propose to use word
cluster features. We first produce distributed word
representations (or word embeddings) of Vietnamese
words, where each word is represented by a dense,
real-valued vector of 50 dimensions, by using a Skip-
gram model described in [20], [21]. We then cluster
these word vectors into 128 groups using a Gaussian
mixture model.2 A word cluster feature is defined as
the cluster identifier of the concerned word.
C. Results and Discussions
1) Evaluation Method: We use a 10-fold cross-validation
method to evaluate our system. The final accuracy scores is
the average scores of the 10 runs.
The evaluation metrics are the precision, recall and F1-
measure. The precision (P) is the proportion of labelled
arguments identified by the system which are correct; the
recall (R) is the proportion of labelled arguments in the
gold results which are correctly identified by the system; and
the F1-measure is the harmonic mean of P and R, that is
F1 = 2PR/(P + R).
2) Baseline System: In the first experiment, we compare
our constituent extraction algorithm to the 1-1 node mapping
algorithm. Table II shows the performance of two extraction
algorithms.
We see that our extraction algorithm outperforms signifi-
cantly the 1-1 node mapping algorithm, in both of the precision
and the recall ratios. In particular, the precision of the 1-1
node mapping algorithm is only 29.53%; this means that this
method captures many candidates which are not arguments. In
contrast, our algorithm is able to identify a large number of

correct argument candidates, particularly with the recall ratio
of 86.43%. This result clearly demonstrates that we cannot take
for granted that a good algorithm for English could also work
well for another language of different characteristics.
In the second experiment, we continue to compare the
performance of the two extraction algorithms, this time at the
final classification step and get the baseline for Vietnamese
SRL. The classifier we use in this experiment is a Maximum
Entropy classifier.3 Table III shows the accuracy of the baseline
system.

One again, this result confirms that our algorithm is much
superior than the 1-1 node mapping algorithm. The F1 of our
baseline SRL system is 50.45%, compared to 6.20% of the 1-1
node mapping system. This result can be explained by the fact
that the 1-1 node mapping algorithm has a very low recall ratio,
because it identifies incorrectly many argument candidates.
3) Labelling Strategy: In the third experiment, we compare
two labelling strategies for Vietnamese SRL (cf. Section III).
In addition to the ME classifier, we also try the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier, which usually gives good accuracy
in a wide variety of classification problems.4 Table IV shows
the F1 scores of different labelling strategies.

We see that the SVM classifier outperforms ME the classi-
fier by a large margin. The best accuracy is obtained by using
1-step stragegy with SVM classifier. The current SRL system
achieves an F1 score of 68.91%.
4) Feature Analysis: In the fourth experiment, we analyse
and evaluate the impact of each individual feature to the
accuracy of our system so as to find the best feature set for
our Vietnamese SRL system. We start with the basic feature
set presented previously, denoted by Φ0 and augment it with
modified and new features as shown in Table V. The accuracy
of these feature sets are shown in Table VI.

at 1.

We notice that amongst the three features, function tag
is the most important feature which increases the accuracy
of the baseline feature set by about 4% of F1 score. The
distance feature also helps increase slightly the accuracy. We
thus consider the fourth feature set Φ4 defined as
Φ4 = Φ0 ∪{Function Tag} ∪{Distance}.
In the fifth experiment, we modify the feature set Φ4 by
replacing the predicate with its cluster and similarly, replacing
the head word with its cluster, replacing the full path with
its partial path, resulting in feature sets Φ5, Φ6, and Φ7
respectively (see Table VII). The accuracy of these feature sets
are shown in Table VIII.

We observe that using the predicate cluster instead of the
predicate itself helps improve the accuracy of the system by
about 0.47% of F1 score. For ease of later presentation, we
rename the feature set Φ5 as Φ8.
In the sixth experiment, we investigate the significance of
individual features to the system by removing them, one by
one from the feature set Φ8. By doing this, we can evaluate the
importance of each feature to our overall system. The feature
sets and their corresponding accuracy are presented in Table IX
and Table X respectively.
We see that the accuracy increases slightly when either the
predicate cluster feature (Φ10) or the subcategorization feature
(Φ15) is removed. However, removing both of the two features
(Φ16) makes the accuracy decrease. For this reason, we remove
only the subcategorization feature. The best feature set includes
the following features: predicate cluster, phrase type, function
tag, parse tree path, distance, voice, position and head word.
The best accuracy of our system is 73.53% of F1 score.
5) Learning Curve: In the last experiment, we investigate
the dependence of accuracy to the size of the training dataset.
Figure 9 depicts the learning curve of our system when the
data size is varied.

It seems that the accuracy of our system improves only
slightly starting from the dataset of about 2,000 sentences.
Nevertheless, the curve has not converged, indicating that the
system could achieve a better accuracy when a larger dataset
is available.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented the first system for
Vietnamese semantic role labelling. Our system achieves a
good accuracy of about 73.5% of F1 score in the Vietnamese
PropBank.
We have argued that one cannot assume a good applica-
bility of existing methods and tools developed for English
and other Western languages and that they may not offer
a cross-language validity. For an isolating language such as
Vietnamese, techniques developed for inflectional languages
cannot be applied “as is”. In particular, we have developed
an algorithm for extracting argument candidates which has a
better accuracy than the 1-1 node mapping algorithm. We have
proposed some novel features which are proved to be useful for
Vietnamese SRL, notably predicate clusters and function tags.
Our SRL system, including software and corpus, is available as
an open source project for free research purpose and we believe
that it is a good baseline for the development and comparison
of future Vietnamese SRL systems.
In the future, we plan to improve further our system, in
the one hand, by enlarging our corpus so as to provide more
data for the system. On the other hand, we would like to
investigate different models used in SRL, for example joint
models [14] and recent inference techniques, such as integer
linear programming [22], [23].
