Abstract
In this paper, we study semantic role labelling (SRL), a subtask of semantic parsing of natural language sentences
and its application for the Vietnamese language. We present our effort in building Vietnamese PropBank, the first
Vietnamese SRL corpus and a software system for labelling semantic roles of Vietnamese texts. In particular, we
present a novel constituent extraction algorithm in the argument candidate identification step which is more suitable
and more accurate than the common node-mapping method. In the machine learning part, our system integrates
distributed word features produced by two recent unsupervised learning models in two learned statistical classifiers
and makes use of integer linear programming inference procedure to improve the accuracy. The system is evaluated
in a series of experiments and achieves a good result, an F1 score of 74.77%. Our system, including corpus and
software, is available as an open source project for free research and we believe that it is a good baseline for the
development of future Vietnamese SRL systems.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we study semantic role labelling
(SRL), a subtask of semantic parsing of natural
language sentences. SRL is the task of identifying
semantic roles of arguments of each predicate in a
sentence. In particular, it answers a question Who
did what to whom, when, where, why?. For each
predicate in a sentence, the goal is to identify
all constituents that fill a semantic role, and to
determine their roles, such as agent, patient, or
instrument, and their adjuncts, such as locative,
temporal or manner.
Figure

In
this
example,
the
arguments of the predicate giúp (helped) are
labelled with their semantic roles. The meaning
of the labels will be described in detail in
Section 2.2.

SRL has been used in many natural language
processing (NLP) applications such as question
answering [1], machine translation [2], document
summarization [3] and information extraction [4].
Therefore, SRL is an important task in NLP.

The first SRL system was developed by Gildea
and Jurafsky [5]. This system was performed
on the English FrameNet corpus. Since then,
SRL task has been widely studied by the NLP
community. In particular, there have been two
shared-tasks, CoNLL-2004 [6] and CoNLL-2005
[7], focusing on SRL task for English. Most of the
systems participating in these shared-tasks treated
this problem as a classification problem which
can be solved by supervised machine learning
techniques. There exists also several systems for
other well-studied languages like Chinese [8] or
Japanese [9].
This paper covers not only the contents of
two works published in conference proceedings
[10] (in Vietnamese) and [11] on the construction
and the evaluation of a first SRL system for
Vietnamese, but also an extended investigation
of techniques used in SRL. More concretely,
the use of integer linear programming inference
procedure and distributed word representations in
our semantic role labelling system, which leads to
improved results over our previous work, as well
as a more elaborate evaluation are new for this
article.
Our system includes two main components,
a SRL corpus and a SRL software which is
thoroughly evaluated. We employ the same
development
methodology
of
the
English
PropBank to build a SRL corpus for Vietnamese
containing a large number of syntactically parsed
sentences with predicate-argument structures.
We then use this SRL corpus and supervised
machine learning models to develop a SRL
software for Vietnamese. We demonstrate that a
simple application of SRL techniques developed
for
English
or
other
languages
could
not
give
a
good
accuracy
for
Vietnamese.
In
particular, in the constituent identification step,
the widely used 1-1 node-mapping algorithm
for extracting argument candidates performs
poorly on the Vietnamese dataset, having F1
score of 35.93%. We thus introduce a new
algorithm for extracting candidates, which is
much more accurate, achieving an F1 score of
84.08%. In the classification step, in addition
to the common linguistic features, we propose
novel and useful features for use in SRL,
including function tags and distributed word
representations. These features are employed in
two statistical classification models, maximum
entropy and support vector machines, which
are proved to be good at many classification
problems. In order to incorporate important
grammatical
constraints
into
the
system
to
improve further the performance, we combine
machine learning techniques with an inference
procedure based on integer linear programming.
Finally, we use distributed word representations
produced by two recent unsupervised models,
the Skip-gram model and the GloVe model, on
a large corpus to alleviate the data sparseness
problem. These word embeddings help our SRL
software system generalize well on unseen words.
Our final system achieves an F1 score of 74.77%
on a test corpus. This system, including corpus
and software, is available as an open source
project for free research and we believe that it
is a good baseline for the development of future
Vietnamese SRL systems.
The remainder of this paper is structured as
follows. Section 2 describes the construction of
a SRL corpus for Vietnamese. Section 3 presents
the development of a SRL software, including
the methodologies of existing systems and of our
system. Section 4 presents the evaluation results
and discussion. Finally, Section 5 concludes the
paper and suggests some directions for future
work.
2. Vietnamese SRL Corpus
Like many other problems in NLP, annotated
corpora are essential for statistical learning as
well as evaluation of SRL systems. In this section,
we start with an introduction of existing English
SRL corpora. Then we present our work on the
construction of the first reference SRL corpus for
Vietnamese.
2.1. Existing English SRL Corpora
2.1.1. FrameNet
The FrameNet project is a lexical database of
English. It was built by annotating examples of

Figure 2: example sentence in the FrameNet corpus

how words are used in actual texts. It consists of
more than 10,000 word senses, most of them with
annotated examples that show the meaning and
usage and more than 170,000 manually annotated
sentences [12]. This is the most widely used
dataset upon which SRL systems for English have
been developed and tested.
FrameNet is based on the Frame Semantics
theory [13]. The basic idea is that the meanings
of most words can be best understood on the basis
of a semantic frame: a description of a type of
event, relation, or entity and the participants in it.
All members in semantic frames are called frame
elements. For example, a sentence in FrameNet
is annotated in cooking concept as shown in
Figure 2.
2.1.2. PropBank
PropBank is a corpus that is annotated with
verbal propositions and their arguments [14].
PropBank tries to supply a general purpose
labelling of semantic roles for a large corpus
to support the training of automatic semantic
role labelling systems. However, defining such
a universal set of semantic roles for all types
of predicates is a difficult task; therefore, only
Arg0 and Arg1 semantic roles can be generalized.
In addition to the core roles, PropBank defines
several adjunct roles that can apply to any verb. It
is called Argument Modifier. The semantic roles
covered by the PropBank are the following:
• Core
Arguments
(Arg0-Arg5,
ArgA):
Arguments define predicate specific roles.
Their semantics depend on predicates in the
sentence.
• Adjunct
Arguments
(ArgM-*):
General
arguments that can belong to any predicate.
There are 13 types of adjuncts.
Figure 3: An example sentence in the PropBank corpus
The boy
Arg0
grills their catches
Arg1
on an open fire
Arg2
• Reference
Arguments
(R-*):
Arguments
represent arguments realized in other parts
of the sentence.
• Predicate (V): Participant realizing the verb
of the proposition.
For example, the sentence of Figure 2 can be
annotated in the PropBank role schema as shown
in Figure 3.
The
English
PropBank
methodology
is
currently implemented for a wide variety of
languages such as Chinese, Arabic or Hindi with
the aim of creating parallel PropBanks1. This
SRL resource has a great impact on many natural
language processing tasks and applications.
2.1.3. VerbNet
VerbNet is a verb lexicon of English, which
was developed by Karin Kipper-Schuler and
colleagues [15]. It contains more than 5800
English verbs, which are classified into 270
groups, according to the verb classification
method of Beth Levin [16]. In this approach, the
behavior of a verb is mostly determined by its
meaning.
Once classified into groups, each verb group is
added semantic roles. VerbNet has 23 semantic
roles, for example
• Actor, the participant that is the investigator
of an event.
• Agent, the actor in an event who initiates
and carries out the event and who exists
independently of the event.
• Attribute, the undergoer that is a property of
an entity or entities.

• Destination, the goal that is a concrete,
physical location.
These syntactic roles normally answer who, what,
when and how questions. A SRL annotation
guidelines of this project is available online 2. In
summary, SRL corpora have been constructed for
English and other well-resourced languages. They
are important resources which are very useful for
many natural language processing applications.
For the Vietnamese language, there has not
existed any SRL corpus which with a similar level
like those of English corpora described above. In
the following sections, we report our initiatives
for constructing and evaluating a SRL corpus for
Vietnamese.
2.2. Building a Vietnamese PropBank
In this section, we present the construction of
a Vietnamese SRL corpus, which is referred as
Vietnamese PropBank hereafter. We first describe
annotation guidelines and then describe the SRL
corpus which has been developed.
2.2.1. Vietnamese SRL Annotation Guidelines
The determination of semantic roles in the
Vietnamese language is a difficult problem and
it has been investigated with different opinions.
In general, Vietnamese linguists have not reached
a consensus on a list of semantic roles for the
language. Different linguists proposed different
lists; some used the same name but with different
meaning of a role, or different names having the
same meaning.
Nevertheless,
one
can
use
an
important
principle
for
determining
semantic
roles:
"Semantic role is the actual role a participant
plays in some situation and it always depends
on the nature of that situation" [17]. This means
that when identifying the meaning of a phrase
or of a sentence, one must not separate it out of
the underlying situation that it appears. While
there might be some controversy about the
exact semantic role names should be, one can
2http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/VerbNet_Guidelines.pdf
list common semantic roles which have been
accepted by most of Vietnamese linguists [18].
The syntactic sub-categorization frames are
closely related to the verb meanings. That is,
the meaning of a sentence can be captured by
the subcategorization frame of the verb predicate.
In consequence, the sentence meaning can be
described by labelling the semantic roles for
each participant in the sub-categorization frame
of the predicate. This approach is adopted by
many Vietnamese linguists and different semantic
roles set have been proposed. For example, Cao
Xuân Hạo [17] makes use of the argument
(obligatory participants) roles as agent, actor,
processed, force, carrier, patient, experiencer,
goal, etc., while Diệp Quang Ban [19] makes
use of fact categories: dynamic, static, mental,
existential, verbal, relational etc. For adjuncts
(optional participants), Cao Xuân Hạo uses the
roles: manner, mean, result, path, etc., while Diệp
Quang Ban makes use of circumstance types:
time, space, cause, condition, goal, result, path,
etc.
In this work, we took a pragmatic standpoint
during the design of a semantic role tagset and
focused our attention on the SRL categories
that we expect to be most necessary and useful
in practical applications. We have constructed
a semantic role tagset based on two following
principles:
• The semantic roles are well-defined and
commonly accepted by the Vietnamese
linguist community.
• The semantic
roles
are comparable
to
those of the English PropBank corpus,
which make them helpful and advantageous
for constructing multi-lingual corpora and
applications in later steps. Furthermore,
it seems fairly indisputable that there are
structural and semantic correspondences
accross languages.
We have selected a SRL tagset which is basically
similar to that of the PropBank. However, some
roles are made more fine-grained accounting
for idiosyncratic properties of the Vietnamese

5
language. In addition, some new roles are added
to better distinguish predicate arguments when
the predicate is an adjective, a numeral, a noun or
a preposition, which is a common phenomenon in
Vietnamese besides the popular verbal predicate.
The
following
paragraph
describes
some
semantic roles of predicative arguments where
the predicate is a verb:
• Arg0: The agent semantic role representing
a person or thing who is the doer of an event.
For example,
Nam
Arg0
đến trường (Nam goes to school.)
• Arg0-Identified
and
Arg1-Identifier: The
semantic
roles
representing identified entity and identifier
respectively, normally used with the copula
“là”. For example,
Cầu thủgiỏi nhất ởđây
Arg0−Identified
là
anh ấy
Arg1−Identifier
(He is the best player here.)
• Arg1-Patient: The semantic role which is
the surface object of a predicate indicating
the person or thing affected. For example,
Bộđội phá
cầu
Arg1-Patient
(The soldiers broke a bridge.)
• Arg2: The semantic role of a beneficiary
indicating a referent who is advantaged or
disadvantaged by an event. For example,
Nó chữa cái xe cho chịấy
Arg2
(He repaired a bike for her.)
Figure 4 presents an example of the SRL analysis
of a syntactically bracketed sentence “Ba đứa con
anh đã có việc làm ổn định.” (His three children
have had a permanent job.). The semantic roles of
this sentence include:
• Arg0: “ba đứa con anh” (his three children)
is the agent
• ArgM-TMP: “đã” is a temporal modifier
• Rel: “có” (have) is the predicate
• Arg1: “việc làm ổn định” (a permanent job)
is the patient.

2.2.2. Vietnamese SRL Corpus
Once the SRL annotation guidelines have been
designed, we built a Vietnamese SRL corpus by
following two main steps.
In the first step, we proposed a set of
conversion rules to convert automatically a
syntactically
annotated
treebank
containing
10,000
manually
annotated
sentences
(the
VietTreeBank)
to
a
coarse-grained
SRL
annotated corpus.
The Vietnamese treebank is one result of a
national project which aims to develop basic
resources and tools for Vietnamese language and
speech processing3. The raw texts of the treebank
are collected from the social and political sections
of the Youth online daily newspaper. The corpus
is divided into three sets corresponding to
three annotation levels: word-segmented, part-
of-speech-tagged and syntax-annotated set. The
syntax-annotated corpus, a subset of the part-
of-speech-tagged set, is currently composed of
10, 471 sentences (225, 085 tokens). Sentences

range from 2 to 105 words, with an average length
of 21.75 words. There are 9, 314 sentences of
length 40 words or less. The tagset of the treebank
has 38 syntactic labels (18 part-of-speech tags, 17
syntactic category tags, 3 empty categories) and
17 function tags. For details, please refer to [20]4.
The meanings of some common tags are listed in

The

contains 24 role names which are all based on
the main roles of the PropBank. We carefully
investigated the tagset of the VietTreeBank
based on detailed guidelines of constituency
structures, phrasal types, functional tags, clauses,
parts-of-speech and adverbial functional tagset to
propose a set of rules for determining high-level
semantic roles. Some rules for coarse-grained
annotation are shown in Table 2. Each rule is
used to determine a semantic role for a phrase of
a sentence.
As an example, consider the constituency
analysis of a sentence in the VietTreeBank “Kia
là những ngôi nhà vách đất.” (Over there are soil-
wall houses.)
(S (NP-SUB (P-H Kia)) (VP (V-H là)

preceding the predicate of the sentence, we
can annotate the semantic role Arg0 for the
word “Kia”. The predicate “là” is annotated
with semantic role REL. Finally, the noun phrase
following the predicate “những ngôi nhà vách
đất” is annotated with Arg1.

In the second step, we developed a software
to help a team of Vietnamese linguists manually
revise and annotate the converted corpus with
fine-grained semantic roles. The software is web-
based, friendly and easy for correction and edition
of multiple linguists. In addition, it also permits a
collaborative work where any edition at sentence
level is versionized and logged with meta-
information so as to facilitate cross validation and
discussion between linguists if necessary.

Vietnamese which is constructed and evaluated
on this SRL corpus.
3. Vietnamese SRL System
3.1. Existing Approaches
This section gives a brief survey of common
approaches which are used by many existing SRL
systems of well-studied languages. These systems
are investigated in two aspects: (a) the data type
that the systems use and (b) their approaches for
labelling semantic roles, including model types,
labelling strategies, degrees of granularity and
post-processing.
3.1.1. Data Types
The input data of a SRL system are typically
syntactically parsed sentences. There are two
common
syntactic
representations
namely
bracketed trees and dependency trees. Some
systems use bracketed trees of sentences as
input data. A bracketed tree of a sentence is
the tree of nested constituents
representing
its constituency structure. Some systems use
dependency trees of a sentence, which represents
dependencies between individual words of a
sentence. The syntactic dependency represents
the fact that the presence of a word is licensed
by another word which is its governor. In a
typed dependency analysis, grammatical labels
are added to the dependencies to mark their
grammatical
relations,
for
example
nominal
subject (nsubj) or direct object (dobj). Figure 5
shows the bracketed tree and the dependency tree
of an example sentence.

3.1.2. SRL Strategy
Input Structures. The first step of a SRL system
is to extract constituents that are more likely to
be arguments or parts of arguments. This step
is called argument candidate extraction. Most of
SRL systems for English use 1-1 node mapping
method to find candidates. This method searches
all nodes in a parse tree and maps constituents and
arguments. Many systems use a pruning strategy
on bracketed trees to better identify argument
candidates [8].
Model Types. In a second step, each argument
candidate is labelled with a semantic role. Every
SRL system has a classification model which can
be classified into two types, independent model
or joint model. While an independent model
decides the label of each argument candidate
independently of other candidates, a joint model
finds the best overall labelling for all candidates
in the sentence at the same time. Independent
models are fast but are prone to inconsistencies
such as argument overlap, argument repetition or
argument missing. For example, Figure 6 shows
some examples of these inconsistencies when
analyzing the Vietnamese sentence Do học chăm,
Nam đã đạt thành tích cao (By studying hard,
Nam got a high achievement).
Labelling
Strategies. Strategies
for
labelling
semantic roles are diverse, but they can be
classified into three main strategies. Most of the
systems use a two-step approach consisting of
identification and classification [21, 22]. The first
step identifies arguments from many candidates,
which
is
essentially
a
binary
classification
problem. The second step classifies the identified
arguments into particular semantic roles. Some
systems use a single classification step by adding
a “null” label into semantic roles, denoting that
this is not an argument [23]. Other systems
consider SRL as a sequence tagging problem
[24, 25].
Granularity. Existing SRL systems use different
degrees
of
granularity
when
considering
constituents. Some systems use individual words
as their input and perform sequence tagging to

(c) Missing argument
identify arguments. This method is called word-
by-word (W-by-W) approach. Other systems
use syntactic
phrases
as input
constituents.
This method is called constituent-by-constituent
(C-by-C) approach. Compared to the W-by-
W approach, C-by-C approach has two main
advantages. First, phrase boundaries are usually
consistent with argument boundaries. Second,
C-by-C approach allows us to work with larger
contexts due to a smaller number of candidates
in comparison to the W-by-W approach. Figure 7
presents an example of C-by-C and W-by-W
approaches.

(a) Example of C-by-C
Nam gi´up Huy học bài vào hôm qua
(b) Example of W-by-W
Post-processing. To improve the final result,
some systems use post-processing to correct
argument
labels.
Common
post-processing
methods include re-ranking, Viterbi search and
integer linear programming (ILP).
3.2. Our Approach
The previous subsection has reviewed existing
techniques for SRL which have been published so
far for well-studied languages. In this section, we
first show that these techniques per se cannot give
a good result for Vietnamese SRL, due to some
inherent difficulties, both in terms of language
characteristics and of the available corpus. We
then develop a new algorithm for extracting
candidate constituents for use in the identification
step.
Some difficulties of Vietnamese SRL are
related to its SRL corpus. As presented in the
previous section, this SRL corpus has 5,460
annotated sentences, which is much smaller than
SRL corpora of other languages. For example,
the English PropBank contains about 50,000
sentences, which is about ten times larger. While
smaller in size, the Vietnamese PropBank has
more semantic roles than the English PropBank
has – 28 roles compared to 21 roles. This makes
the unavoidable data sparseness problem more
severe for Vietnamese SRL than for English SRL.
In addition, our extensive inspection and
experiments on the Vietnamese PropBank have
uncovered that this corpus has many annotation
errors, largely due to encoding problems and
inconsistencies in annotation. In many cases, we
have to fix these annotation errors by ourselves.
In other cases where only a proposition of a
complex sentence is incorrectly annotated, we
perform an automatic preprocessing procedure
to drop it out, leave the correctly annotated
propositions untouched. We finally come up with
a corpus of 4,800 sentences which are semantic
role annotated.
A major difficulty of Vietnamese SRL is
due to the nature of the language,
where
its linguistic characteristics are different from
occidental languages [26]. We first try to apply
the common node-mapping algorithm which is
widely used in English SRL systems to the
Vietnamese corpus. However, this application


## Page 9

9
gives us a very poor performance. Therefore,
in the identification step, we develop a new
algorithm for extracting candidate constituents
which is much more accurate for Vietnamese
than the node-mapping algorithm. Details of
experimental results will be provided in the
Section 4.
In order to improve the accuracy of the
classification step, and hence of our SRL system
as a whole, we have integrated many useful
features for use in two statistical classification
models, namely Maximum Entropy (ME) and
Support Vector Machines (SVM). On the one
hand, we adapt the features which have been
proved
to
be
good
for
SRL
of
English.
On the other hand, we propose some novel
features, including function tags, predicate type
and distance.
Moreover, to improve further
the performance of our system, we introduce
some appropriate constraints and apply a post-
processing method by using ILP. Finally, to better
handle unseen words, we generalize the system by
integrating distributed word representations.
In the next paragraphs, we first present our
constituent extraction algorithm to get inputs for
the identification step and then the ILP post-
processing method. Details of the features used in
the classification step and the effect of distributed
word representations in SRL will be presented in
Section 4.
3.2.1. Constituent Extraction Algorithm
Our
algorithm
derives
from
the
pruning
algorithm
for
English
[27]
with
some
modifications.
While
the
original
algorithm
collects sisters of the current node, our algorithm
checks the condition whether or not children
of each sister have the same phrase label
and have different function label from their
parent. If they have the same phrase labels and
different function labels from their parent, our
algorithm collects each of them as an argument
candidate. Otherwise, their parent is collected as
a candidate. In addition, we remove the constraint
that does not collect coordinated nodes from the
original algorithm.
This algorithm aims to extract constituents
from a bracketed tree which are associated to
their corresponding predicates of the sentence.
If the sentence has multiple predicates, multiple
constituent sets corresponding to the predicates
are extracted. The pseudo code of the algorithm
is described in Algorithm 1.

This algorithm uses several simple functions.
The root() function gets the root of a tree. The
children() function gets the children of a node.
The sibling() function gets the sisters of a node.
The isPhrase() function checks whether a node
is of phrasal type or not. The phraseType()
function and
functionTag() function extracts
the phrase type and function tag of a node,
respectively. Finally, the collect(node) function
collects words from leaves of the subtree rooted
at a node and creates a constituent.

algorithm on a sentence Bà nói nó là con trai tôi
mà (You said that he is my son). First, we find the
current predicate node V-H là (is). The current
node has only one sibling NP node. This NP
node has three children where some of them have
different labels from their parents, so this node
and its associated words are collected. After that,
we set current node to its parent and repeat the
process until reaching the root of the tree. Finally,
we obtain a tree with the following constituents
for predicate là: Bà, nói, nó, and con trai tôi mà.
3.2.2. Integer Linear Programming
Because
the
system
classifies
arguments
independently, labels assigned to arguments in
a sentence may violate Vietnamese grammatical
constraints.
To
prevent
such
violation
and
improve the result, we propose a post-processing
process which finds the best global assignment
that also satisfies grammatical constraints. Our
work is based on the ILP method of English
PropBank
[28].
Some
constraints
that
are
unique to Vietnamese are also introduced and
incorporated.
Integer programs are almost identical to linear
programs. The cost function and the constraints
are all in linear form. The only difference is that
the variables in ILP can only take integer values.
A general binary ILP can be stated as follows.
Given a cost vector ⃗p ∈Rd, a set of variables
⃗z = (z1, . . . , zd) ∈Rd, and cost matrices C1 ∈
Rt1 × Rd, C2 ∈Rt2 × Rd, where t1, t2 are the
number of inequality and equality constraints and
d is the number of binary variables. The ILP
solution ˆ⃗z is the vector that maximizes the cost
function:
ˆ⃗z = argmax
⃗z∈0,1d
⃗p ·⃗z
subject to

C1⃗z ≥⃗b1
C2⃗z = ⃗b2
(1)
where ⃗b1,⃗b2 ∈Rd.
Our system attempts to find exact roles for
argument candidate set for each sentence. This set
is denoted as S 1:M, where the index ranged from
1 to M; and the argument role set is denoted as
P. Assuming that the classifier returns a score,
score(S i = ci), corresponding to the likelihood of
assigning label ci to argument S i. The aim of the
system is to find the maximal overall score of the
arguments:
ˆc1:M = argmax
c1:M∈PM score(S 1:M = c1:M)
(2)
= argmax
c1:M∈PM

score(S i = ci)

ILP Constraints. In this paragraph, we propose a
constraint set for our SRL system. Some of them
are directly inspired and derived from results

for English SRL, others are constraints that
we specify uniquely to account for Vietnamese
specificities. The constraint set includes:
1. One argument can take only one type.
2. Arguments cannot overlap with the predicate
in the sentence.
3. Arguments cannot overlap other arguments
in the sentence.
4. There
is
no
duplicating
argument
phenomenon for core arguments in the
sentence.
5. If the predicate is not verb type, there are
only 2 types of core argument Arg0 and
Arg1.
In particular,
constraints
from 1 to 4 are
derived from the ILP method for English [28],
while constraint 5 is designed specifically for
Vietnamese.
ILP
Formulation. To
find
the
best
overall
labelling
satisfying
these
constraints,
we
transform our system to an ILP problem. First, let
zic = [S i = c] be the binary variable that shows
whether or not S i is labelled argument type c.
We denote pic = score(S i = c). The objective
function of the optimization problem can be
written as:
argmax
z∈0,1
M
X
i=1
|P|
X
c=1
piczic.
(4)
Next, each constraint proposed above can be
reformulated as follows:
1. One argument can take only one type.
|P|
X
c=1
zic = 1,
∀i ∈[1, M].
(5)
2. Arguments cannot overlap with the predicate
in the sentence.
3. Arguments cannot overlap other arguments
in the sentence. If there are k arguments
S 1, S 2, ..., S k that appear in a same word in
the sentence, we can conclude that there are
at least k −1 arguments that are classified as
“null”:
k
X
i=1
zic ≥k −1
(c = “null”).
(6)
This constraint has been satisfied by our
constituent extraction approach. Thus, we do
not need to add this constraint in the post-
processing step if the constituent extraction
algorithm has been used.
4. There
is
no
duplicating
argument
phenomenon for core arguments in the
sentence.
M
X
i=1
zic ≤1,
∀c ∈Arg0, Arg1, Arg2, Arg3, Arg4	 .

5. If the predicate is not verb type, there are
only 2 types of core argument Arg0 and
Arg1.
M
X
i=1
zic = 0
∀c ∈Arg2, Arg3, Arg4	 . (8)
In the next section, we present experimental
results, system evaluation and discussions.
4. Evaluation
In this section, we describe the evaluation of
our SRL system. First, we first introduce two
feature sets used in machine learning classifiers.
Then, the evaluation results are presented and
discussed. Next, we report the improved results
by using integer linear programming inference
method. Finally, we present the efficacy of
distributed word representations in generalizing
the system to unseen words.
4.1. Feature Sets
We use two feature sets in this study. The
first one is composed of basic features which are
commonly used in SRL system for English. This
feature set is used in the SRL system of Gildea
and Jurafsky [5] on the FrameNet corpus.


## Page 12


12
Phuong Le-Hong et al. / VNU Journal of Science: Comp. Science & Com. Eng., Vol. ..., No. ... (2017) 1–21
4.1.1. Basic Features
This feature set consists of 6 feature templates,
as follows:
1. Phrase type: This is very useful feature in
classifying semantic roles because different
roles
tend
to
have
different
syntactic
categories. For example, in the sentence in
Figure 8 Bà nói nó là con trai tôi mà, the
phrase type of constituent nó is NP.
2. Parse tree path: This feature captures the
syntactic relation between a constituent and
a predicate in a bracketed tree. This is
the shortest path from a constituent node
to a predicate node in the tree. We use
either symbol ↑or symbol ↓to indicate the
upward direction or the downward direction,
respectively. For example, the parse tree path
from constituent nó to the predicate là is
NP↑S↓VP↓V.
3. Position: Position is a binary feature that
describes whether the constituent occurs
after
or before the predicate.
It
takes
value 0 if the constituent appears before
the predicate in the sentence or value 1
otherwise. For example, the position of
constituent nó in Figure 8 is 0 since it
appears before predicate là.
4. Voice:
Sometimes,
the
differentiation
between active and passive voice is useful.
For example, in an active sentence, the
subject is usually an Arg0 while in a passive
sentence, it is often an Arg1. Voice feature is
also binary feature, taking value 1 for active
voice or 0 for passive voice. The sentence
in Figure 8 is of active voice, thus its voice
feature value is 1.
5. Head word: This is the first word of a phrase.
For example, the head word for the phrase
con trai tôi mà is con trai.
6. Subcategorization:
Subcategorization
feature
captures
the
tree
that
has
the
concerned
predicate
as
its
child.
For
example, in Figure 8, the subcategorization
of the predicate là is VP(V, NP).
4.1.2. New Features
Preliminary investigations on the basic feature
set give us a rather poor result. Therefore, we
propose some novel features so as to improve
the accuracy of the system. These features are as
follows:
1. Function tag: Function tag is a useful
information,
especially
for
classifying
adjunct
arguments.
It
determines
a
constituent’s role, for example, the function
tag of constituent nó is SUB, indicating that
this has a subjective role.
2. Distance: This feature records the length of
the full parse tree path before pruning. For
example, the distance from constituent nó to
the predicate là is 3.
3. Predicate type: Unlike in English, the type
of predicates in Vietnamese is much more
complicated. It is not only a verb, but is
also a noun, an adjective, or a preposition.
Therefore, we propose a new feature which
captures predicate types. For example, the
predicate type of the concerned predicate is
V.
4.2. Results and Discussions
4.2.1. Evaluation Method
We use a 10-fold cross-validation method to
evaluate our system. The final accuracy scores is
the average scores of the 10 runs.
The evaluation metrics are the precision,
recall and F1-measure. The precision (P) is the
proportion of labelled arguments identified by
the system which are correct; the recall (R)
is the proportion of labelled arguments in the
gold results which are correctly identified by the
system; and the F1-measure is the harmonic mean
of P and R, that is F1 = 2PR/(P + R).
4.2.2. Baseline System
In the first experiment, we compare our
constituent
extraction
algorithm
to
the
1-1
node mapping and the pruning algorithm [28].
Table 3 shows the performance of two extraction
algorithms.
We
see
that
our
extraction
algorithm
outperforms significantly the 1-1 node mapping

algorithm, in both of the precision and the recall
ratios. It is also better than the pruning algorithm.
In particular, the precision of the 1-1 node
mapping algorithm is only 29.58%; it means that
this method captures many candidates which are
not arguments. In contrast, our algorithm is able
to identify a large number of correct argument
candidates, particularly with the recall ratio of
86.12% compared to 79.39% of the pruning
algorithm. This result also shows that we cannot
take for granted that a good algorithm for English
could also work well for another language of
different characteristics.
In the second experiment, we continue to
compare the performance of the two extraction
algorithms, this time at the final classification
step and get the baseline for Vietnamese SRL.
The classifier we use in this experiment is
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier5.
Table 4 shows the accuracy of the baseline
system.

the pruning system. This result can be explained
by the fact that the 1-1 node mapping and
the pruning algorithm have a low recall ratio,
because it identifies incorrectly many argument
candidates.
4.2.3. Labelling Strategy
In the third experiment, we compare two
labelling strategies for Vietnamese SRL. In
addition to the SVM classifier, we also try
the Maximum Entropy (ME) classifier, which
usually gives good accuracy in a wide variety of
classification problems6. Table 5 shows the F1
scores of different labelling strategies.

We see that the performance of SVM classifier
is slightly better than the performance of ME
classifier. The best accuracy is obtained by using
1-step strategy with SVM classifier. The current
SRL system achieves an F1 score of 69.96%.
4.2.4. Feature Analysis
In the fourth experiment, we analyse and
evaluate the impact of each individual feature
to the accuracy of our system so as to find the
best feature set for our Vietnamese SRL system.
We start with the basic feature set presented
previously, denoted by Φ0 and augment it with
modified and new features as shown in Table 6.
The accuracy of these feature sets are shown in
Table 7.

We notice that amongst the three features,
function tag is the most important feature which
increases the accuracy of the baseline feature set
by about 4% of F1 score. The distance feature
also helps increase slightly the accuracy. We thus
consider the fourth feature set Φ4 defined as
Φ4 = Φ0 ∪{Function Tag} ∪{Distance}.
In the fifth experiment, we investigate the
significance of individual features to the system
by removing them, one by one from the feature
set Φ4. By doing this, we can evaluate the
importance of each feature to our overall system.
The feature sets and their corresponding accuracy
are presented in Table 8 and Table 9 respectively.

We see that the accuracy increases slightly
when the subcategorization feature (Φ11) is
removed. For this reason, we remove only the
subcategorization feature. The best feature set
includes the following features: predicate, phrase
type, function tag, parse tree path, distance, voice,
position and head word. The accuracy of our
system with this feature set is 74.37% of F1 score.

4.2.5. Improvement
via
Integer
Linear
Programming
As discussed previously, after classifying the
arguments, we use ILP method to help improve
the overall accuracy. In the sixth experiment,
we set up an ILP to find the best performance
satisfying constraints presented earlier7. The
score pic = score(S i = c) is the signed distance
of that argument to the hyperplane. We also
compare our ILP system with the ILP method for
English by using only constraints from 1 to 4. The
improvement given by ILP is shown in Table 10.
We see that ILP increases the performance of
about 0.4% and when adding constraint 5, the
result is slightly better. The accuracy of for each
argument is shown in Table 11.
A detailed investigation of our constituent
extraction algorithm reveals that it can account
for about 86% of possible argument candidates.
Although this coverage ratio is relatively high,
it is not exhaustive. One natural question to ask

is whether an exhaustive search of argument
candidates could improve the accuracy of the
system or not. Thus, in the seventh experiment,
we replace our constituent extraction algorithm
by an exhaustive search where all nodes of a
syntactic tree are taken as possible argument
candidates. Then, we add the third constraint to
the ILP post-processing step as presented above
(Arguments cannot overlap other arguments in
the sentence). An accuracy comparison of two
constituent extraction algorithms is shown in
Table 12.

Taking all nodes of a syntactic tree help
increase the number of candidate argument to
a coverage ratio of 93.25%. However, it also
proposes many wrong candidates as shown by a
low precision ratio. Table 13 shows the accuracy
of our system in the two candidate extraction
approaches.

We see that an exhaustive search of candidates
help present more possible constituent candidates
but it makes the performance of the system
worse than the constituent extraction algorithm
(69.39% compared to 74.73% of F1 ratio). One
plausible explanation is that the more a classifier
has candidates to consider, the more it is likely
to make wrong classification decision, which
results in worse accuracy of the overall system.
In addition, a large number of candidates makes
the system lower to run. In our experiment, we
see the training time increased fourfold when the
exhaustive search approach was used instead of
our constituent extraction algorithm.
4.2.6. Learning Curve
In the ninth experiment, we investigate the
dependence of accuracy to the size of the training
dataset. Figure 9 depicts the learning curve of our
system when the data size is varied.
It seems that the accuracy of our system
improves only slightly starting from the dataset
of about 2,000 sentences. Nevertheless, the curve
has not converged, indicating that the system
could achieve a better accuracy when a larger
dataset is available.
4.3. Generalizing to Unseen Words
In this section, we report our effort to extend
the applicability of our SRL system to new
text domain where rare or unknown words are
common. As seen in the previous systems, some

important features of our SRL system are word
features including predicates and head words.
As in most NLP tasks, the words are usually
encoded as symbolic identifiers which are drawn
from a vocabulary. Therefore, they are often
represented
by one-hot
vectors (also called
indicator vectors) of the same length as the size of
the vocabulary. This representation suffers from
two major problems. The first problem is data
sparseness, that is, the parameters corresponding
to rare or unknown words are poorly estimated.
The second problem is that it is not able to
capture the semantic similarity between closely
related words. This limitation of the one-hot
word representation has motivated unsupervised
methods for inducing word representations over
large, unlabelled corpora.
Recently, distributed representations of words
have been shown to be advantageous for many
natural language processing tasks. A distributed
representation is dense, low dimensional and
real-valued. Distributed word representations are
called word embeddings. Each dimension of the
embedding represents a latent feature of the word
which hopefully captures useful syntactic and
semantic similarities [29].
Word embeddings are typically induced using
neural
language
models,
which
use
neural
networks as the underlying predictive model.
Historically,
training
and
testing
of
neural
language models has been slow, scaling as
the size of the vocabulary for each model
computation [30]. However, many approaches
have been recently proposed to speed up the
training process, allowing scaling to very large
corpora [31, 32, 33, 34].
Another method to produce word embeddings
has been introduced recently by the natural
language
processing
group
at
the
Stanford
university [35]. They proposed a global log-
bilinear regression model that combines the
advantages of the two major model families in the
literature: global matrix factorization and local
context window methods.
We present in the subsections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
how we use a neural language model and a global
log-bilinear regression model, respectively, to
produce word embeddings for Vietnamese which
are used in this study.
4.3.1. Skip-gram Model
We
use
word
embeddings
produced
by
Mikolov’s continuous Skip-gram model using the
neural network and source code introduced in
[36]. The continuous skip-gram model itself is
described in details in [34].
For our experiments we used a continuous
skip-gram window of size 2, i.e. the actual
context size for each training sample is a random
number up to 2. The neural network uses the
central word in the context to predict the other
words, by maximizing the average conditional log
probability

T

j=−c
log p(wt+j|wt),
(9)
where {wi : i ∈T} is the whole training set, wt
is the central word and the wt+j are on either side
of the context. The conditional probabilities are
defined by the softmax function
p(a|b) =
exp(o⊤
a ib)
P
w∈V
exp(o⊤wib),
(10)

17
where iw and ow are the input and output vector
of w respectively, and V is the vocabulary.
For computational efficiency, Mikolov’s training
code approximates the softmax function by the
hierarchical softmax, as defined in [31]. Here the
hierarchical softmax is built on a binary Huffman
tree with one word at each leaf node. The
conditional probabilities are calculated according
to the decomposition:
p(a|b) =
lY
i=1
p(di(a)|d1(a)...di−1(a), b),
(11)
where l is the path length from the root to the node
a, and di(a) is the decision at step i on the path
(for example 0 if the next node the left child of
the current node, and 1 if it is the right child). If
the tree is balanced, the hierarchical softmax only
needs to compute around log2 |V| nodes in the
tree, while the true softmax requires computing
over all |V| words.
The training code was obtained from the
tool word2vec8 and we used frequent word
subsampling as well as a word appearance
threshold of 5. The output dimension is set
to 50, i.e. each word is mapped to a unit
vector in R50. This is deemed adequate for
our purpose without overfitting the training
data. Figure 10 shows the scatter plot of some
Vietnamese words which are projected onto the
first two principal components after performing
the principal component analysis of all the
word distributed representations. We can see that
semantically related words are grouped closely
together.
4.3.2. GloVe Model
Pennington,
Socher,
and
Manning
[35]
introduced the global vector model for learning
word representations (GloVe). Similar to the
Skip-gram model, GloVe is a local context
window method but it has the advantages of the
global matrix factorization method.
The main idea of GloVe is to use word-word
occurrence counts to estimate the co-occurrence
8http://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

gram model, projected onto two dimensions.
probabilities rather than the probabilities by
themselves. Let Pij denote the probability that
word j appear in the context of word i; wi ∈Rd
and w j ∈Rd denote the word vectors of word i
and word j respectively. It is shown that
w⊤
i w j = log(Pij) = log(Cij) −log(Ci),
(12)
where Cij is the number of times word j occurs in
the context of word i.
It turns out that GloVe is a global log-
bilinear regression model. Finding word vectors
is equivalent to solving a weighted least-squares
regression model with the cost function:
J =
n
X
i, j=1
f(Cij)(w⊤
i w j +bi +bj −log(Cij))2, (13)
where n is the size of the vocabulary, bi and bj
are additional bias terms and f(Cij) is a weighting
function. A class of weighting functions which
are found to work well can be parameterized as
f(x) =

Figure 11: Some Vietnamese words produced by the GloVe
model, projected onto two dimensions.
The training code was obtained from the tool
GloVe9 and we used a word appearance threshold
of 2,000. Figure 11 shows the scatter plot of the
same words in Figure 10, but this time their word
vectors are produced by the GloVe model.
4.3.3. Text Corpus
To create distributed word representations, we
use a dataset consisting of 7.3GB of text from 2
million articles collected through a Vietnamese
news portal10. The text is first normalized to
lower case and all special characters are removed
except these common symbols: the comma,
the semicolon, the colon, the full stop and
the percentage sign. All numeral sequences are
replaced with the special token <number>, so that
correlations between certain words and numbers
are correctly recognized by the neural network or
the log-bilinear regression model.
Each word in the Vietnamese language may
consist of more than one syllables with spaces
in between, which could be regarded as multiple
words by the unsupervised models. Hence it
9http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
10http://www.baomoi.com
is necessary to replace the spaces within each
word with underscores to create full word tokens.
The tokenization process follows the method
described in [37].
After
removal
of
special
characters
and
tokenization, the articles add up to 969 million
word tokens, spanning a vocabulary of 1.5
million unique tokens. We train the unsupervised
models with the full
vocabulary
to obtain
the
representation
vectors,
and
then
prune
the collection of word vectors to the 65, 000
most frequent words, excluding special symbols
and the token <number> representing numeral
sequences.
4.3.4. SRL
with
Distributed
Word
Representations
We train the two word embedding models
on the same text corpus presented
in the
previous subsections to produce distributed word
representations, where each word is represented
by a real-valued vector of 50 dimensions.
In the last experiment, we replace predicate or
head word features in our SRL system by their
corresponding word vectors. For predicates which
are composed of multiple words, we first tokenize
them into individual words and then average their
vectors to get vector representations. Table 14 and
Table 15 shows performances of the Skip-gram
and GloVe models for predicate feature and for
head word feature, respectively.

We see that both of the two types of word
embeddings do not decrease the accuracy of
the system. In other words, their use can help
generalize the system to unseen words.

5. Conclusion
We have presented our work on developing a
semantic role labelling system for the Vietnamese
language.
The
system
comprises
two main
component, a corpus and a software. Our system
achieves a good accuracy of about 74.8% of F1
score.
We have argued that one cannot assume
a good applicability of existing methods and
tools developed for English and other occidental
languages and that they may not offer a cross-
language validity. For an isolating language
such as Vietnamese, techniques developed for
inflectional languages cannot be applied “as is”.
In particular, we have developed an algorithm
for extracting argument candidates which has
a better accuracy than the 1-1 node mapping
algorithm. We have proposed some novel features
which are proved to be useful for Vietnamese
semantic role labelling, notably and function
tags and distributed word representations. We
have employed integer linear programming, a
recent inference technique capable of incorporate
a wide variety of linguistic constraints to improve
the performance of the system. We have also
demonstrated the efficacy of distributed word
representations produced by two unsupervised
learning models in dealing with unknown words.
In the future, we plan to improve further our
system, in the one hand, by enlarging our corpus
so as to provide more data for the system. On the
other hand, we would like to investigate different
models used in SRL, for example joint models
[38], where arguments and semantic roles are
jointly embedded in a shared vector space for
a given predicate. In addition, we would like
to explore the possibility of integrating dynamic
constraints in the integer linear programming
procedure. We expect the overall performance of
our SRL system to improve.
Our system, including software and corpus,
is available as an open source project for free
research purpose and we believe that it is a good
baseline for the development and comparison of
future Vietnamese SRL systems11. We plan to
integrate this tool to Vitk, an open-source toolkit
for processing Vietnamese text, which contains
fundamental processing tools and are readily
scalable for processing very large text data12.
