Abstract
Among
the
six
challenges
of
neural
machine
translation
(NMT)
coined
by
(Koehn and Knowles,
2017),
rare-word
problem is considered the most severe one,
especially
in
translation
of
low-resource
languages.
In this paper, we propose three
solutions to address the rare words in neural
machine translation systems.
First,
we
enhance source context to predict the target
words by connecting directly the source
embeddings to the output of the attention
component in NMT. Second, we propose an
algorithm to learn morphology of unknown
words for English in supervised way in order
to minimize the adverse effect of rare-word
problem.
Finally, we exploit synonymous
relation from the WordNet to overcome out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) problem of NMT. We
evaluate our approaches on two low-resource
language
pairs:
English-Vietnamese
and
Japanese-Vietnamese. In our experiments, we
have achieved signiﬁcant improvements of up
to roughly +1.0 BLEU points in both language
pairs.

Introduction
NMT
systems
have
achieved
better
perfor-
mance compared to statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) systems in recent years not only
on available data language pairs (Sennrich et al.,
2016a;
Cho et al., 2016),
but
also
on
low-
resource
language
pairs
(Nguyen and Chiang,
2017; Cettolo et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, NMT
still exists many challenges which have adverse
effects on its effectiveness (Koehn and Knowles,
2017). One of these challenges is that NMT has
biased tend in translating high-frequency words,
thus words which have lower frequencies are of-
ten translated incorrectly. This challenge has also
been conﬁrmed again in (Nguyen and Chiang,
2017), and they have proposed two strategies to
tackle this problem with modiﬁcations on the
model’s output distribution:
one for normaliz-
ing some matrices by ﬁxing them to constants
after several training epochs and another for
adding a direct connection from source embed-
dings through a simple feed forward neural net-
work (FFNN). These approaches increase the size
and the training time of their NMT systems. In this
work, we follow their second approach but sim-
plify the computations by replacing FFNN with
two single operations.
Despite above approaches can improve the pre-
diction of rare words, however, NMT systems of-
ten use limited vocabularies in their sizes, from
30K to 80K most frequent words of the training
data, in order to reduce computational complex-
ity and the sizes of the models (Bahdanau et al.,
2015; Luong et al., 2015b), so the rare-word trans-
lation are still problematic in NMT. Even when
we use a larger vocabulary, this situation still ex-
ists (Jean et al., 2015). A word which has not seen
in the vocabulary of the input text (called unknown
word) are presented by the unk symbol in NMT
systems. Inspired by alignments and phrase ta-
bles in phrase-based machine translation (SMT) as
suggested by (Koehn et al., 2007), (Luong et al.,
2015b) proposed to address OOV words using an
annotated training corpus. They then used a dic-
tionary generated from alignment model or maps
between source and target words to determine the
translations of unks if translations are not found.
(Sennrich et al., 2016b) proposed to reduce un-
known words using Gage’s Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) algorithm (Gage, 1994), but NMT systems
are less effective for low-resource language pairs
due to the lack of data and also for other lan-
guages that sub-word are not the optimal transla-
tion unit. In this paper, we employ several tech-
niques inspired by the works from NMT and the
traditional SMT mentioned above.
Instead of a


## Page 2


loosely unsupervised approach, we suggest a su-
pervised approach to solve this trouble using syn-
onymous relation of word pairs from WordNet on
Japanese→Vietnamese and English→Vietnamese
systems. To leverage effectiveness of this relation
in English, we transform variants of words in the
source texts to their original forms by separating
their afﬁxes collected by hand.
Our contributes in this work are:
• We release the state-of-the-art for Japanese-
Vietnamese NMT systems.
• We proposed the approach to deal with the
rare word translation by integrating source
embeddings to the attention component of
NMT.
• We present a supervised algorithm to re-
duce the number of unknown words for the
English→Vietnamese translation system.
• We demonstrate the effectiveness of leverag-
ing linguistic information from WordNet to
alleviate the rare-word problem in NMT.

Neural Machine Translation
Our NMT system use a bidirectional recurrent
neural network (biRNN) as an encoder and a
single-directional RNN as a decoder with input
feeding of (Luong et al., 2015a) and the attention
mechanism of (Bahdanau et al., 2015). The En-
coder’s biRNN are constructed by two RNNs with
the hidden units in the LSTM cell, one for for-
ward and the other for backward of the source sen-
tence x = (x1, ..., xn). Every word xi in sen-
tence is ﬁrst encoded into a continuous represen-
tation Es(xi), called the source embedding. Then
x is transformed into a ﬁxed-length hidden vec-
tor hi representing the sentence at the time step i,
which called the annotation vector, combined by
the states of forward −→
h i and backward ←−
h i:
−→
h i = f(Es(xi), −→
h i−1)
←−
h i = f(Es(xi), ←−
h i+1)
The decoder generates the target sentence y =
(y1, ..., ym), and at the time step j, the predicted
probability of the target word yj is estimated as
follows:
p(yj|y<j, x) ∝softmax(Wzj + b)
where zj is the output hidden states of the at-
tention mechanism and computed by the previous
output hidden states zj−1, the embedding of pre-
vious target word Et(yj−1) and the context cj:
zj = g(Et(yj−1), zj−1, cj)
The source context cj is the weighted sum of
the encoder’s annotation vectors hi:
cj = Pn
i=1 αijhi
where αij are the alignment weights, denoting the
relevance between the current target word yj and
all source annotation vectors hi.

Rare Word translation
In this section, we present the details about our
approaches to overcome the rare word situation.
While the ﬁrst strategy augments the source con-
text to translate low-frequency words, the remain-
ing strategies reduce the number of OOV words in
the vocabulary.
3.1
Low-frequency Word Translation
The attention mechanism in RNN-based NMT
maps the target word into source context corre-
sponding through the annotation vectors hi.
In
the recurrent hidden unit, hi is computed from
the previous state ht−1.
Therefore, the infor-
mation ﬂow of the words in the source sen-
tence may be diminished over time. This leads
to the accuracy reduction when translating low-
frequency words, since there is no direct connec-
tion between the target word and the source word.
To alleviate the adverse impact of this problem,
(Nguyen and Chiang, 2017) combined the source
embeddings with the predictive distribution over
the output target word in several following steps:
Firstly, the weighted average vector of the
source embeddings is computed as follows:
lt = tanh
X
e
αj(e)fe
where αj(e) are alignment weights in the attention
component and fe = Es(x), are the embeddings
of the source words.
Then lj is transformed through one-hidden-
layer FFNN with residual connection proposed by
(He et al., 2015):
tj = tanh(Wllj) + lj
Finally, the output distribution over the target word
is calculated by:
p(yj|y<j, x) = softmax(Wzj + b + Wttj + bt)
The matrices Wl, Wt and bt are trained together
with other parameters of the NMT model.


## Page 3


This approach improves the performance of the
NMT systems but introduces more computations
as the model size increase due to the additional
parameters Wl, Wt and bt.
We simplify this
method by using the weighted average of source
embeddings directly in the softmax output layer:
p(yj|y<j, x) = softmax(W(zj + lj) + b)
Our method does not learn any additional parame-
ters. Instead, it requires the source embedding size
to be compatible with the decoder’s hidden states.
With the additional information provided from the
source embeddings, we achieve similar improve-
ments compared to the more expensive method de-
scribed in (Nguyen and Chiang, 2017).
3.2
Reducing Unknown Words
In
our
previous
experiments
for
English→Vietnamese,
BPE
algo-
rithm (Sennrich et al., 2016b) applied to the
source side does not signiﬁcantly improves the
systems despite it is able to reduce the number
of unknown English words. We speculate that it
might be due to the morphological differences be-
tween the source and the target languages (English
and Vietnamese in this case). The unsupervised
way of BPE while learning sub-words in English
thus might be not explicit enough to provide the
morphological information to the Vietnamese
side.
In this work, we would like to attempt a
more explicit, supervised way.
We collect 52
popular afﬁxes (preﬁxes and sufﬁxes) in English
and then apply the separating afﬁxes algorithm
(called SAA) to reduce the number of unknown
words as well as to force our NMT systems to
learn better morphological mappings between two
languages.
The main ideal of our SAA is to separate afﬁxes
of unknown words while ensuring that the rest of
them still exists in the vocabulary. Let the vocab-
ulary V containing K most frequency words from
the training set T1, a set of preﬁxes P, a set of suf-
ﬁxes S, we call word w′ is the rest of an unknown
word or rare word w after delimiting its afﬁxes.
We iteratively pick a w from N words (including
unknown words and rare words) of the source text
T2 to consider if w starts with a preﬁx p in P or
ends with a sufﬁx s in S, we then determine split-
ting its afﬁxes if w′ in V . A rare word in V also
can be separated its afﬁxes if its frequency is less
than the given threshold. We set this threshold by
2 in our experiments. Similarly to BPE approach,
we also employ a pair of the special symbol @
for separating afﬁxes from the word. Listing 3.2
shows our SAA algorithm.

3.3
Dealing with OOV using WordNet
WordNet is a lexical database grouping words into
sets which share some semantic relations.
Its
version for English is proposed for the ﬁrst time
by (Fellbaum, 1998).
It becomes a useful re-
source for many tasks of natural language process-
ing (Kolte and Bhirud, 2008; Méndez O., 2013;
Gao et al., 2014). WordNet are available mainly
for English and German, the version for other lan-
guages are being developed including some Asian
languages in such as Japanese, Chinese, Indone-
sian and Vietnamese.
Several works have em-
ployed WordNet in SMT systems(Khodak et al.,
2017; Arcan et al., 2019) but to our knowledge,
none of the work exploits the beneﬁts of WordNet
in order to ease the rare word problem in NMT.
In this work, we propose the learning synonymous
algorithm (called LSW) from the WordNet of En-
glish and Japanese to handle unknown words in
our NMT systems.
In WordNet, synonymous words are organized
in groups which are called synsets.
Our aim is
to replace an OOV word by its synonym which
appears in the vocabulary of the translation sys-
tem.
From the training set of the source lan-
guage T1, we extract the vocabulary V in size


## Page 4


of K most frequent words. For each OOV word
from T1, we learn its synonyms which exist in
the V from the WordNet W. The synonyms are
then arranged in the descending order of their fre-
quencies to facilitate selection of the n best words
which have the highest frequencies. The output
ﬁle C of the algorithm contains OOV words and
its corresponding synonyms and then it is applied
to the input text T2. We also utilize a frequency
threshold for rare words in the same way as in
SAA algorithm. In practice, we set this thresh-
old as 0, meaning no words on V is replaced
by its synonym. If a source sentence has m un-
known words and each of them has n best syn-
onyms, it would generate mn sentences. Transla-
tion process allow us to select the best hypothe-
sis based on their scores. Because of each word
in the WordNet can belong to many synsets with
different meanings, thus an inappropriate word
can be placed in the current source context. We
will solve this situation in the further works. Our
systems only use 1-best synonym for each OOV
word.
Listing 3.3 presents the LSW algorithm.

Experiments
We evaluate our approaches on the English-
Vietnamese and the Japanese-Vietnamese trans-
lation systems. Translation performance is mea-
sured in BLEU (Kishore Papineni and Zhu, 2012)
by the multi-BLEU scripts from Moses1.
1https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/tree/master/scripts
4.1
Datasets
We consider two low-resource language pairs:
Japanese-Vietnamese
and
English-Vietnamese.
For
Japanese-Vietnamese,
we use
the
TED
data provided by WIT3 (Cettolo et al., 2012)
and
compiled
by
(Ngo et al.,
2018).
The
training set includes 106758 sentence pairs,
the
validation
and
test
sets
are
dev2010
(568 pairs) and tst2010 (1220 pairs).
For
English→Vietnamese, we use the dataset from
IWSLT 2015 (Mauro Cettolo and Federico, 2015)
with around 133K sentence pairs for the training
set, 1553 pairs in tst2012 as the validation and
1268 pairs in tst2013 as the test sets.
For LSW algorithm, we crawled pairs of syn-
onymous words from Japanese-English Word-
Net2 and achieved 315850 pairs for English and
1419948 pairs for Japanese.
4.2
Preprocessing
For English and Vietnamese, we tokenized the
texts and then true-cased the tokenized texts using
Moses script. We do not use any word segmenta-
tion tool for Vietnamese. For comparison purpose,
Sennrich’s BPE algorithm is applied for English
texts. Following the same preprocessing steps for
Japanese (JPBPE) in (Ngo et al., 2018), we use
KyTea3 (Neubig et al., 2011) to tokenize texts and
then apply BPE on those texts. The number of
BPE merging operators are 50k for both Japanese
and English.
4.3
Systems and Training
We
implement
our
NMT
systems
using
OpenNMT-py
framework4
(Klein et al.,
2017)
with the same settings as in (Ngo et al., 2018) for
our baseline systems. Our system are built with
two hidden layers in both encoder and decoder,
each layer has 512 hidden units. In the encoder, a
BiLSTM architecture is used for each layer and
in the decoder, each layer are basically an LSTM
layer. The size of embedding layers in both source
and target sides is also 512. Adam optimizer is
used with the initial learning rate of 0.001 and
then we apply learning rate annealing. We train
our systems for 16 epochs with the batch size of
32. Other parameters are the same as the default
settings of OpenNMT-py.

Results
In this section, we show the effectiveness of
our methods on two low-resource language pairs
and compare them to the other works.
The
empirical results are shown in Table 1 for
Japanese-Vietnamese and in Table 3 for English-
Vietnamese. Note that, the Multi-BLEU is only
measured in the Japanese→Vietnamese direction
and the standard BLEU points are written in
brackets.
4.4.1
Japanese-Vietnamese Translation
We conduct two out of the three proposed ap-
proaches for Japanese-Vietnamese translation sys-
tems and the results are given in the Table 1.
Baseline Systems.
We ﬁnd that our transla-
tion systems which use Sennrich’s BPE method
for Japanese texts and do not use word segmen-
tation for Vietnamese texts are neither better or in-
signiﬁcant differences compare to those systems
used word segmentation in (Ngo et al., 2018). Par-
ticularly, we obtained +0.38 BLEU points between
(1) and (4) in the Japanese→Vietnamese and -
0.18 BLEU points between (1) and (3) in the
Vietnamese→Japanese.
Our Approaches. On the systems trained with
the modiﬁed architecture mentioned in the sec-
tion 3.1, we obtained an improvements of +0.54
BLEU points in the Japanese→Vietnamese and
+0.42 BLEU points on the Vietnamese→Japanese
compared to the baseline systems.
Due to the fact that Vietnamese WordNet
is not available, we only exploit WordNet to
tackle unknown words of Japanese texts in our
Japanese→Vietnamese translation system. After
using Kytea, Japanese texts are applied LSW al-
gorithm to replace OOV words by their synonyms.
We choose 1-best synonym for each OOV word.
Table 2 shows the number of OOV words replaced
by their synonyms. The replaced texts are then
BPEd and trained on the proposed architecture.
The largest improvement is +0.92 between (1) and
(3). We observed an improvement of +0.7 BLEU
points between (3) and (5) without using data aug-
mentation described in (Ngo et al., 2018).

English-Vietnamese Translation
We examine the effect of all approaches pre-
sented in Section 3 for our English-Vietnamese
translation
systems.
Table

summarizes
those results and the scores from other sys-
tems (Nguyen and Chiang, 2017; Huang et al.,
2018).
Baseline systems.
After preprocessing data
using Moses scripts, we train the systems of
English↔Vietnamese on our baseline architec-
ture. Our translation system obtained +0.82 BLEU
points compared to (Nguyen and Chiang, 2017) in
the English→Vietnamese and this is lower than
the system of (Huang et al., 2018) with neural
phrase-based translation architecture.
Our approaches. The datasets from the base-
line systems are trained on our modiﬁed NMT
architecture.
The improvements can be found
as +0.55 BLEU points between (1) and (2)
in the English→Vietnamese and +0.45 BLEU


## Page 6


points (in tst2012) between (1) and (2) in the
Vietnamese→English.
For comparison purpose, English texts are split
into sub-words using Sennrich’s BPE methods.
We observe that, the achieved BLEU points are
lower Therefore, we then apply the SAA al-
gorithm on the English texts from (2) in the
English→Vietnamese.
The number of applied
words are listed in Table 4. The improvement in
BLEU are +0.74 between (4) and (1).
Similarly to the Japanese→Vietnamese system,
we apply LSW algorithm on the English texts from
(4) while selecting 1-best synonym for each OOV
word. The number of replaced words on English
texts are indicated in the Table 5. Again, we ob-
tained a bigger gain of +0.99 (+1.02) BLEU points
in English→Vietnamese direction. Compared to
the most recent work (Huang et al., 2018), our
system reports an improvement of +0.47 standard
BLEU points on the same dataset.
We investigate some examples of translations
generated by the English→Vietnamese systems
with our proposed methods in the Table 6. The
bold texts in red color present correct or approx-
imate translations while the italic texts in gray
color denote incorrect translations. The ﬁrst ex-
ample, we consider two words: presentation and
the unknown word applauded. The word presen-
tation is predicted correctly as "bài thuyết trình"
in most cases when we combined source con-
text through embeddings. The unknown word ap-
plauded which has not seen in the vocabulary is
ignored in the ﬁrst two cases (baseline and source
embedding) but it is roughly translated as "hoan
nghênh" in the SAA because it is separated into
applaud and ed. In the second example, we ob-
serve the translations of the unknown word tryout,
they are mistaken in the ﬁrst three cases but in the
LSW, it is predicted with a closer meaning as "bài
kiểm tra" due to the replacement by its synony-
mous word as test.

Related Works
Addressing unknown words was mentioned early
in the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) sys-
tems. Some typical studies as: (Habash, 2008)
proposed four techniques to overcome this situ-
ation by extend the morphology and spelling of
words or using a bilingual dictionary or translit-
erating for names.
These approaches are difﬁ-
cult when manipulate to different domains. (Trieu,
2016) trained word embedding models to learn
word similarity from monolingual data and an
unknown word are then replaced by a its simi-
lar word. (Madhyastha and España Bonet, 2017)
used a linear model to learn maps between source
and target spaces base on a small initial bilin-
gual dictionary to ﬁnd the translations of source
words. However, in NMT, there are not so many
works tackling this problem.
(Jean et al., 2015)
use a very large vocabulary to solve unknown
words.
(Luong et al., 2015b) generate a dictio-
nary from alignment data based on annotated cor-
pus to decide the hypotheses of unknown words.
(Nguyen and Chiang, 2017) have introduced the
solutions for dealing with the rare word problem,
however, their models require more parameters,
thus, decreasing the overall efﬁciency.
In another direction, (Sennrich et al., 2016b)
exploited the BPE algorithm to reduce number
of unknown words in NMT and achieved signif-
icant efﬁciency on many language pairs. The sec-
ond approach presented in this works follows this
direction when instead of using an unsupervised
method to split rare words and unknown words
into sub-words that are able to translate, we use
a supervised method. Our third approach using
WordNet can be seen as a smoothing way, when
we use the translations of the synonymous words
to approximate the translation of an OOV word.
Another work followed this direction is worth to
mention is (Niehues et al., 2016), when they use
the morphological and semantic information as the
factors of the words to help translating rare words.

Conclusion
In this study, we have proposed three difference
strategies to handle rare words in NMT, in which
the combination of methods brings signiﬁcant im-
provements to the NMT systems on two low-
resource language pairs. In future works, we will
consider selecting some appropriate synonymous
words for the source sentence from n-best synony-
mous words to further improve the performance
of the NMT systems and leverage more unsuper-
vised methods based on monolingual data to ad-
dress rare word problem.
