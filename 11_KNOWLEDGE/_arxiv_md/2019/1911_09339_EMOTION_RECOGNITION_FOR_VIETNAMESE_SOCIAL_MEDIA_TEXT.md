Abstract. Emotion recognition or emotion prediction is a higher ap-
proach or a special case of sentiment analysis. In this task, the result
is not produced in terms of either polarity: positive or negative or in
the form of rating (from 1 to 5) but of a more detailed level of analysis
in which the results are depicted in more expressions like sadness, en-
joyment, anger, disgust, fear and surprise. Emotion recognition plays a
critical role in measuring brand value of a product by recognizing spe-
cific emotions of customers’ comments. In this study, we have achieved
two targets. First and foremost, we built a standard Vietnamese Social
Media Emotion Corpus (UIT-VSMEC) with exactly 6,927 emotion-
annotated sentences, contributing to emotion recognition research in
Vietnamese which is a low-resource language in natural language pro-
cessing (NLP). Secondly, we assessed and measured machine learning
and deep neural network models on our UIT-VSMEC corpus. As a re-
sult, the CNN model achieved the highest performance with the weighted
F1-score of 59.74%. Our corpus is available at our research website 1.

Introduction
Expressing emotion is a fundamental need of human and that we use language
not just to convey facts, but also our emotions [7]. Emotions determine the
quality of our lives, and we organize our lives to maximize the experience of
positive emotions and minimize the experience of negative emotions [4]. Thus,
Paul Ekman [3] proposed six basic emotions of human including enjoyment,

sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust through facial expression. Nonetheless,
apart from facial expression, many different sources of information can be used
to analyze emotions since emotion recognition has emerged as an important
research area. And in recent years, emotion recognition in text has become more
popular due to its vast potential applications in marketing, security, psychology,
human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and so on [11].
In this study, we focus on the problem of recognizing emotions for Vietnamese
comments on social network. To be more specific, the input of the problem is a
Vietnamese comment from social network, and the output is a predicted emotion
of that comment labeled with one of these: enjoyment, sadness, anger, surprise,
fear, disgust and other. Several examples are shown in Table 1.

In this paper, our two key contributions are summarized as follows.
– One of the most primary contributions is to obtain the UIT-VSMEC corpus,
which is the first corpus for emotion recognition for Vietnamese social media
text. As a result, we achieved 6,927 emotion annotated-sentences. To ensure
that only the best results with high consistency and accuracy are reached,
we built a very coherent and thorough annotation guideline for the dataset.
The corpus is publicly available for research purpose.
– The second one, we tried using four learning algorithms on our UIT-VSMEC
corpus, two machine learning models consisting of Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Random Forest versus two deep learning models including Con-
volutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
The structure of the paper is organized thusly. Related documents and studies
are presented in Section II. The process of building corpus, annotation guidelines,
and dataset evaluation are described in Section III. In Section IV, we show how
to apply SVM, Random Forest, CNN, and LSTM for this task. The experimental

results are analyzed in Section V. Conclusion and future work are deduced in
Section VI.

Related Work
There are some related work in English and Chinese. In 2007, the SemEval-2007
Task 14 [20] developed a dataset for emotion recognition with six emotion classes
(enjoyment, anger, disgust, sadness, fear and surprise) including 1,250 newspa-
per headline human-annotated sentences. In 2012, Mohammad [11] published an
emotion corpus with 21,052 comments from Tweets annotated also by six labels
of emotion (enjoyment, anger, disgust, sadness, fear and surprise). In 2017, Mo-
hammad [10] again published a corpus annotated with only four emotion labels
(anger, fear, enjoyment and sadness) for 7,079 comments from Tweets. In 2018,
Wang [22] put out a bilingual corpus in Chinese and English for emotion recog-
nition including 6,382 sentences tagged by five different emotions (enjoyment,
sadness, fear, anger and surprise). In general, corpus for emotion recognition
task use some out of six basic emotions of human (enjoyment, sadness, anger,
disgust, fear and surprise) based on Ekman’s emotion theory [3].
In terms of algorithms, Kratzwald [9] tested the efficiency of machine learn-
ing algorithms (Random Forest and SVM) and deep learning algorithms (Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiL-
STM)) combined with pre-trained word embeddings on multiple emotion cor-
pora. In addition, the BiLSTM combined with pre-trained word embeddings
reached the highest result of 58.2% of F1-score compared to Random Forest and
SVM with 52.6% and 54.2% respectively on the General Tweets corpus [9]. Like-
wise, Wang [21] proposed the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Multiple
Classifiers (BLSTM-MC) model on a bilingual corpus in Chinese and English
that achieved the F1-score of 46.7%, ranked third in the shared task NLPCC2018
- Task 1 [22].
In Vietnamese, there are quite a quantity of research works on other NLP
tasks such as parsing [26,27], part-of-speech [28,29], named entity recognition
[30,31], sentiment analysis [16,17,18] and question answering [32,33]. However,
there are no research publications on emotion recognition for Vietnamese social
media texts. Therefore, we decided to build a first corpus of Vietnamese emotion
recognition for the research purposes. In this paper, we evaluate machine learning
(SVM and Random Forest) and deep learning models (CNN and LSTM) on our
corpus.

Corpus Construction
In this section, we present the process of developing the UIT-VSMEC corpus in
Section 3.1, annotation guidelines in Section 3.2, corpus evaluation in Section
3.3 and corpus analysis in Section 3.4.

Fig. 1: Overview of corpus-building process.
Phase 1 - Collecting data: We collect data from Facebook which is the
most popular social network in Vietnam. In particular, according to a survey
of 810 Vietnamese people conducted by [2] in 2018, Facebook is used the most
in Vietnam. Moreover, as reported by the statistic of the number of Facebook
users by [25], there are 58 million Facebook users in Vietnam, ranking as the 7th
country with the most users in the world. As the larger the number of the users
and the more interaction between them, the richer the data. And to collect the
data, we use Facebook API to get Vietnamese comments from public posts.
Phase 2 - Pre-processing data: To ensure users’ privacy, we replace users’
names in the comments with PER tag. The rest of the comments is kept as it is
to retain the properties of a comment on social network.
Phase 3 - Annotating data: This step is divided into two stages: Stage
1, building annotation guidelines and training for four annotators. Data tagging
is repeated for 806 sentences along with editing guidelines until the consensus
reaches more than 80%. Stage 2, 6,121 sentences are shared equally for three an-
notators while the another checking the whole 6,121 sentences and the consensus
between the two is above 80%.
3.2
Annotation Guidelines
There are many suggestions on the number of basic emotions of human. Accord-
ing to studies in the field of psychology, there are two outstanding viewpoints in
basic human emotions: "Basic Emotions" by Paul Ekman and "Wheel of Emo-
tions" by Robert Plutchik [7]. Paul Ekman’s studies point out that there are


## Page 5


Emotion Recognition for Vietnamese Social Media Text
5
six basic emotions which are expressed through the face [3]: enjoyment, sad-
ness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise. Eight years later, Robert Plutchik gave
an another definition of emotion. In this concept, emotion is divided into eight
basic ones which are polarized in pairs: enjoyment - sadness, anger - fear, trust -
disgust and surprise - anticipation [7]. Despite the agreement on basic emotions,
psychologists dissent from the number of which are the most basic that may
have in humans, some ideas are 6, 8 and 20 or even more [10].
To that end, we chose six labels of basic emotions (enjoyment, sadness, anger,
fear, disgust and surprise) for our UIT-VSMEC corpus based on six basic human
emotions proposed by Ekman [3] together with Other label to mark a sentence
with an emotion out of the six above or a sentence without emotion, consider-
ing most of the automated emotion recognition work in English [13,7] are all
established from Ekman’s emotion theory (1993) and with a large amount of
comments in the corpus, a small number of emotions makes the manual tagging
process more convenient.
Based on Ekman’s instruction in basic human emotions [5], we build anno-
tation guidelines for Vietnamese text with seven emotion labels described as
follows.
– Enjoyment: For comments with the states that are triggered by feeling con-
nection or sensory pleasure. It contains both peace and ecstasy. The intensity
of these states varies from the enjoyment of helping others, a warm uplifting
feeling that people experience when they see kindness and compassion, an
experience of ease and contentment or even the enjoyment of the misfor-
tunes of another person to the joyful pride in the accomplishments or the
experience of something that is very beautiful and amazing. For example,
the emotion of the sentence "Nháy mắt thôi cũng đáng yêu, kkk" (English
translation: "Just the act of winking is so lovely!") is Enjoyment.
– Sadness: For comments that contain both disappointment and despair. The
intensity of its states varies from discouragement, distraughtness, helpless-
ness, hopelessness to strong suffering, a feeling of distress and sadness often
caused by a loss or sorrow and anguish. The Vietnamese sentence "Lúc đấy
khổlắm... kỉniệm :(" (English translation: "It was hard that time..memory
:(" ) has an emotion of Sadness, for instance.
– Fear: For comments that show anxiety and terror. The intensity of these
states varies from trepidation - anticipation of the possibility of danger, ner-
vousness, dread to desperation, a response to the inability to reduce danger,
panic and horror - a mixture of fear, disgust and shock. A given sentence
"Chuyện này làm tao nổi hết da gà" (English translation: "This story causes
me goosebumps") is a Fear labeled-sentence.
– Anger: For comments with states that are triggered by a feeling of being
blocked in our progress. It contains both annoyance and fury and varies
from frustration which is a response to repeated failures to overcome an
obstacle, exasperation - anger caused by strong nuisance, argumentativeness
to bitterness - anger after unfair treatment and vengefulness. For example,

"Biến mẹmày đi!" (English translation: "You fucking get lost!") is labeled
with Angry.
– Disgust: For comments which show both dislike and loathing. Their inten-
sity varies from an impulse to avoid something disgusting or aversion, the
reaction to a bad taste, smell, thing or idea, repugnance to revulsion which
is a mixture of disgust and loathing or abhorrence - a mixture of intense
disgust and hatred. As "Làm bạn với mấy thểloại này nhục cảngười" (En-
glish translation: "Making friends with such types humiliates you") has an
emotion of Disgust.
– Surprise: For comments that express the feeling caused by unexpected
events, something hard to believe and may shock you. This is the short-
est emotion of all emotions, only takes a few seconds. And it passes when
we understand what is happening, and it may become fear, anger, relief or
nothing ... depends on the event that makes us surprise. "Trên đời còn tồn
tại thứnày sao??" (English translation: "How the hell in this world this still
exists??") is annotated with Surprise.
– Other: For comments that show none of those emotions above or comments
that do not contain any emotions. For instance, "Mình đã xem rất nhiều
video như này rồi nên thấy cũng bình thường" (English translation: "I have
seen a lot of videos like this so it’s kinda normal") is neutral, so its label is
Other.
3.3
Corpus Evaluation
We use the Am agreement measure [1] to evaluate the consensus between anno-
tators of the corpus. This agreement measure was also utilized in the UIT-VSFC
corpus [16]. Am is calculated by the following formula.
Am = Po −Pe
1 −Pe
Where, Po is the observed agreement which is the proportion of sentences
with both of the annotators agreed on the classes pairs and Pe is the expected
agreement that is the proportion of items for which agreement is expected by
chance when the sentences are seen randomly.
Table 2 presents the consensus of the entire UIT-VSMEC corpus with two
separate parts. The consensus of 806 sentences which can be seen as the first
stage of annotating data mentioned in section 3-3.1. Am agreement level is high
with 82.94% by four annotators. And the annotation agreement in the second
stage (3-3.1) where X1, X2, X3 are 3 annotators independently tagging data and
Y is the checker of one another. The Am and Po of annotation pair X3-Y are
highest of 89.12% and 92.81%.
3.4
Corpus Analysis
After building the UIT-VSMEC corpus, we obtained 6,927 human-annotated
sentences with one of the seven emotion labels. Statistics of emotion labels of
the corpus is presented in Table 3.

Through Table 3, we concluded that the comments got from social network
are uneven in number among different labels in which the enjoyment label reaches
the highest number of 1,965 sentences (28.36%) while the surprise label arrives
at the lowest number of 309 sentences (4.46%).
Besides, we listed the number of the sentences of each label up to their
lengths. Table 4 shows the distribution of emotion-annotated sentences according
to their lengths. It is easy to see that most of the comments are from 1 to 20
words accounting for 81.76%.

Methodology
In this paper, we use two kinds of methodologies to evaluate the UIT-VSMEC
corpus including two machine learning models (Random Forest and SVM) and
two deep learning models (CNN and LSTM) as the first models described as
follows.
4.1
Machine Learning Models
The authors in [9] proposed SVM and Random Forest algorithms for emotion
recognition. Under which, we also tested three more machine learning algorithms
including Decision Tree, kNN and Naive Bayes on 1,000 emotion-annotated sen-
tences extracted from the UIT-VSMEC corpus by Orange3. Consequently, Ran-
dom Forest achieved the second best result after SVM which is displayed in Table
5. It is the main reason why we chose SVM and Random Forest for experiments
on the UIT-VSMEC corpus.

Random Forest Random Forest is a versatile machine learning algorithm when
used for classification problems, predicting linear regression values and multi-
output tasks. The idea of Random Forest is to use a set of Decision Tree clas-
sification, each of which is trained on different parts of the dataset. After that,
Random Forest will get back all the classification results of the seedlings from
which it chooses the most voted one to give the final result. Despite of its sim-
plicity, Random Forest is one of the most effective machine learning algorithms
today [19].
Support Vector Machine (SVM) We use the SVM machine learning algo-
rithm as a baseline result for this emotion recognition problem. According to the
authors in [13], SVM is an effective algorithm for classification problems with
high features. Here, we use SVM model supported by scikit-learn library.

4.2
Deep Learning Models
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) LSTM is also applied for the UIT-
VSMEC corpus for various reasons. To begin with, LSTM is considered as
the state-of-the-art method of almost sequence prediction problems. Moreover,
through the two competitions WASSA-2018 [8] and SemEval-2018 Task 1 [12]
for emotion recognition task, we acknowledged that LSTM was effectively used
the most. Furthermore, LSTM has advantages over conventional neural networks
and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in many different ways due to its selective
memory characteristic in a long period. This is also the reason why the authors
in [9] chose to use it in his paper. Therefore, we decided to use LSTM on the
same problem on our corpus.
LSTM consists of four main parts: Word embeddings input, LSTM cell net-
work, fully connected and softmax. With the input, each cell in the LSTM net-
work receives a word vector represented by word embeddings with the form [1 x
n] where n is the fixed length of the sentence. Then cells calculate the values and
gets the results as vectors in LSTM cell network. These vectors will go through
fully connected and the output values will then pass through softmax function
to give an appropriate classification for each label.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) We use Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) algorithm which is proposed in [6] to recognize emotions in a sen-
tence. CNN is the algorithm that achieves the best results in four out of the seven
major problems of Natural Language Processing which includes both emotion
recognition and question classification tasks (text classification, language model,
speech recognition, title generator, machine translation, text summarization and
Q&A systems) [6,24].
A CNN model consists of three main parts: Convolution layer, pooling layer
and fully connected layer. In convolution layer - the Kernel, we used 3 types of
filters of different sizes with total 512 filters to extract the high-level features and
obtain convolved feature maps. These then go through the pooling layer which is
responsible for reducing the spatial size of the convolved feature and decreasing
the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality
reduction. The convolutional layer and the pooling layer together form the i-th
layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Moving on, the final output will be
flattened and fed to a regular neural network in the fully connected layer for
classification purposes using the softmax classification technique.

Experiments and Error Analysis
5.1
Corpus Preparation
We at first built a normalized corpus for comparison and evaluation where
spelling errors have been corrected and acronyms in various forms have been
converted back to their original words, seeing it is impossible to avoid such

problems of text on social networks when it does not distinguish any type of
users. Table 6 shows some examples being encountered the most in the dataset.
We then divided the UIT-VSMEC corpus into the ratio of 80:10:10, in which
80% of the corpus is the training set, 10% is the validation one and the rest is
the test set. The UIT-VSMEC corpus is an imbalanced-labels corpus, therefore,
to ensure that sentences in low-volume labels are distributed fully in each set, we
use stratified sampling method utilizing train_test_split() function supported
by scikit learn library to distribute them into training, validation and test sets.
The result is presented in Table 7.

Experimental Settings
In this paper, to represent words in vector form, we use two different methods
word embeddings and bag of words. For the two machine learning models SVM
and Random Forest, we use bag of words in conjunction with TF-IDF. For the
two other deep learning models LSTM and CNN, we utilize pre-trained word
embeddings including word2vec 3 and fastText 4 used as its main techniques.
With machine learning models SVM and Random Forest, grid-search method
is utilized to get the most appropriate parameters for the task. In particular, with

SVM we use word of tag (1, 3) combined with bag of char (1,7) features and loss
function hinge, and to reduce overfitting we apply the l2-regularization technique
with lambd. = 1e-4. About Random Forest model, the number of decision trees
is 256 and the depth of the trees is 64.
For LSTM model, we use the many-to-one architecture due to the classi-
fication requirement of the problem. To select proper parameters for emotion
recognition in Vietnamese, we add two drop-out classes of 0.75 and 0.5 respec-
tively to increase processing time as well as to avoid overfitting.
Regarding deep learning CNN model, we apply three main kernels: 3, 4 and
5 with a number of each is 128. Besides, drop-out of 0.95 and l2 of 0.01 are
adopted to avoid overfitting. Properties and models are developed from Yoon
Kim’s work [6].
5.3
Experimental Results
In this section, we present the results of two experiments. Firstly, we test and
compare the results of each model on the UIT-VSMEC corpus. Secondly, we
evaluate the influence of Other label on this corpus after implementing these
machine learning and deep learning models on the corpus yet without Other
label. All models are evaluated by accuracy and weighted F1-score metrics.

Through this, we concluded that, when removing Other label, the weighted
F1-score reaches higher results with the same methods. Firstly, it is because of
the decrease in number of emotion labels in the UIT-VSMEC corpus from 7 to 6
(anger, enjoyment, surprise, sadness, fear and disgust). Secondly, sentences not
affected by noise data from Other label gives better results. To conclude, Other
label does affect the performance of these algorithms. This will be our focus in
building data in the future. Apart from that, we evaluate the learning curves of

which Random Forest and SVM utilize BoW feature, CNN and LSTM utilize
word2vec embeddings. To conduct this experiment, we keep the test and the
validation sets while putting training set in stages from 2,000 with 500 sentence-
jump until the end of the set (5,548 sentences).

As can be seen in Figure 2, when the size of the training set increases, so does
the weighted F1-scores of the four models despite the slightly drop of 0.092% in
Random Forest when the number of the set grows from 5,000 to 5,500 sentences.
In the meanwhile, compared to LSTM, the two deep learning models reach sig-
nificant higher results, principally CNN combined with word2vec. Thus, we take
this point to continue expanding the corpus as well as improving the performance
of these models.
To demonstrate the performance of classification models, we use confusion
matrix to visualize the ambiguity between actual labels and predicted labels. Fig-
ure 3 is the confusion matrix of the best classification model (CNN + word2vec)
on the UIT-VSMEC corpus. As can be seen, the model performs well on clas-
sifying enjoyment, fear and sadness labels while it confuses between anger and
disgust labels as their ambiguities are at the highest percentage of 39.1%. There
are two reasons causing this confusion. Primarily, it is the inherent vagueness of
the definitions of anger and disgust construed through [23]. Secondly, the data
limitation of these labels is an interference for the model to execute at its best.
We noted this in our next step to continue building a thorough corpus for the
task.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this study, we built a human-annotated corpus for emotion recognition for
Vietnamese social media text for research purpose and achieved 6,927 sentences
annotated with one of the seven emotion labels namely enjoyment, sadness,
anger, surprise, fear, disgust and other with the annotation agreement of over
82%. We also presented machine learning and deep neural network models used
for classifying emotions of Vietnamese social media text. In addition, we reached
the best overall weighted F1-score of 59.74% on the original UIT-VSMEC corpus
with CNN using the word2vec word embeddings.
In the future, we want to improve the quantity as well as the quality of the
corpus due to its limitation of comments expressing emotions of anger, fear and
surprise. Besides, we aim to conduct experiments using other machine learning
models with distinctive features as well as deep learning models with various
word representations or combine both methods on this corpus.
