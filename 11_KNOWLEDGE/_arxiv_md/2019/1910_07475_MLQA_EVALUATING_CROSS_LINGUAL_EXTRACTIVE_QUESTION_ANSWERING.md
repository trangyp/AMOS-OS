Abstract
Question answering (QA) models have shown
rapid progress enabled by the availability of
large, high-quality benchmark datasets. Such
annotated datasets are difﬁcult and costly to
collect, and rarely exist in languages other
than English, making building QA systems
that work well in other languages challeng-
ing. In order to develop such systems, it is
crucial to invest in high quality multilingual
evaluation benchmarks to measure progress.
We present MLQA, a multi-way aligned ex-
tractive QA evaluation benchmark intended to
spur research in this area.1 MLQA contains
QA instances in 7 languages, English, Ara-
bic, German, Spanish, Hindi, Vietnamese and
Simpliﬁed Chinese. MLQA has over 12K in-
stances in English and 5K in each other lan-
guage, with each instance parallel between
4 languages on average.
We evaluate state-
of-the-art cross-lingual models and machine-
translation-based baselines on MLQA. In all
cases, transfer results are signiﬁcantly behind
training-language performance.

Introduction
Question answering (QA) is a central and highly
popular area in NLP, with an abundance of datasets
available to tackle the problem from various angles,
including extractive QA, cloze-completion, and
open-domain QA (Richardson, 2013; Rajpurkar
et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019). The ﬁeld has made rapid advances in recent
years, even exceeding human performance in some
settings (Devlin et al., 2019; Alberti et al., 2019).
Despite such popularity, QA datasets in lan-
guages other than English remain scarce, even
for relatively high-resource languages (Asai et al.,
2018), as collecting such datasets at sufﬁcient
scale and quality is difﬁcult and costly. There

are two reasons why this lack of data prevents in-
ternationalization of QA systems. First, we can-
not measure progress on multilingual QA with-
out relevant benchmark data. Second, we cannot
easily train end-to-end QA models on the task,
and arguably most recent successes in QA have
been in fully supervised settings. Given recent
progress in cross-lingual tasks such as document
classiﬁcation (Lewis et al., 2004; Klementiev et al.,
2012; Schwenk and Li, 2018), semantic role la-
belling (Akbik et al., 2015) and NLI (Conneau
et al., 2018), we argue that while multilingual QA
training data might be useful but not strictly neces-
sary, multilingual evaluation data is a must-have.
Recognising this need, several cross-lingual
datasets have recently been assembled (Asai et al.,
2018; Liu et al., 2019a).
However, these gen-
erally cover only a small number of languages,
combine data from different authors and annota-
tion protocols, lack parallel instances, or explore
less practically-useful QA domains or tasks (see
Section 3).
Highly parallel data is particularly
attractive, as it enables fairer comparison across
languages, requires fewer source language annota-
tions, and allows for additional evaluation setups
at no extra annotation cost. A purpose-built evalua-
tion benchmark dataset covering a range of diverse
languages, and following the popular extractive QA
paradigm on a practically-useful domain would be
a powerful testbed for cross-lingual QA models.
With this work, we present such a benchmark,
MLQA, and hope that it serves as an accelerator
for multilingual QA in the way datasets such as
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) have done for its
monolingual counterpart. MLQA is a multi-way
parallel extractive QA evaluation benchmark in
seven languages: English, Arabic, German, Viet-
namese, Spanish, Simpliﬁed Chinese and Hindi. To
construct MLQA, we ﬁrst automatically identify
sentences from Wikipedia articles which have the
same or similar meaning in multiple languages. We

extract the paragraphs that contain such sentences,
then crowd-source questions on the English para-
graphs, making sure the answer is in the aligned
sentence. This makes it possible to answer the ques-
tion in all languages in the vast majority of cases.2
The generated questions are then translated to all
target languages by professional translators, and
answer spans are annotated in the aligned contexts
for the target languages.
The resulting corpus has between 5,000 and
6,000 instances in each language, and more than
12,000 in English. Each instance has an aligned
equivalent in multiple other languages (always in-
cluding English), the majority being 4-way aligned.
Combined, there are over 46,000 QA annotations.
We deﬁne two tasks to assess performance on
MLQA. The ﬁrst, cross-lingual transfer (XLT), re-
quires models trained in one language (in our case
English) to transfer to test data in a different lan-
guage. The second, generalised cross-lingual trans-
fer (G-XLT) requires models to answer questions
where the question and context language is differ-
ent, e.g. questions in Hindi and contexts in Arabic,
a setting possible because MLQA is highly parallel.
We provide baselines using state-of-the-art cross-
lingual techniques. We develop machine transla-
tion baselines which map answer spans based on
the attention matrices from a translation model, and
use multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and
XLM (Lample and Conneau, 2019) as zero-shot ap-
proaches. We use English for our training language
and adopt SQuAD as a training dataset. We ﬁnd
that zero-shot XLM transfers best, but all models
lag well behind training-language performance.
In summary, we make the following contribu-
tions: i) We develop a novel annotation pipeline
to construct large multilingual, highly-parallel ex-
tractive QA datasets ii) We release MLQA, a 7-
language evaluation dataset for cross-lingual QA
iii) We deﬁne two cross-lingual QA tasks, including
a novel generalised cross-lingual QA task iv) We
provide baselines using state-of-the-art techniques,
and demonstrate signiﬁcant room for improvement.

The MLQA corpus
First, we state our desired properties for a cross-
lingual QA evaluation dataset. We note that whilst
some existing datasets exhibit these properties,
2The automatically aligned sentences occasionally differ
in a named entity or information content, or some questions
may not make sense without the surrounding context. In these
rare cases, there may be no answer for some languages.
none exhibit them all in combination (see section 3).
We then describe our annotation protocol, which
seeks to fulﬁl these desiderata.
Parallel
The dataset should consist of instances
that are parallel across many languages. First, this
makes comparison of QA performance as a func-
tion of transfer language fairer. Second, additional
evaluation setups become possible, as questions
in one language can be applied to documents in
another. Finally, annotation cost is also reduced as
more instances can be shared between languages.
Natural Documents
Building a parallel QA
dataset in many languages requires access to paral-
lel documents in those languages. Manually trans-
lating documents at sufﬁcient scale entails huge
translator workloads, and could result in unnatural
documents. Exploiting existing naturally-parallel
documents is advantageous, providing high-quality
documents without requiring manual translation.
Diverse Languages
A primary goal of cross-
lingual research is to develop systems that work
well in many languages. The dataset should en-
able quantitative performance comparison across
languages with different linguistic resources, lan-
guage families and scripts.
Extractive
QA
Cross-lingual
understanding
benchmarks are typically based on classiﬁca-
tion (Conneau et al., 2018). Extracting spans in
different languages represents a different language
understanding challenge. Whilst there are extrac-
tive QA datasets in a number of languages (see
Section 3), most were created at different times by
different authors with different annotation setups,
making cross-language analysis challenging.
Textual Domain
We require a naturally highly
language-parallel textual domain. Also, it is desir-
able to select a textual domain that matches existing
extractive QA training resources, in order to isolate
the change in performance due to language transfer.
To satisfy these desiderata, we identiﬁed the
method described below and illustrated in Figure 1.
Wikipedia represents a convenient textual domain,
as its size and multi-linguality enables collection of
data in many diverse languages at scale. It has been
used to build many existing QA training resources,
allowing us to leverage these to train QA models,
without needing to build our own training dataset.
We choose English as our source language as it has
the largest Wikipedia, and to easily source crowd

Earth's Moon is an astronomical
body that orbits the planet and acts as its 
only permanent natural satellite. The Moon is, 
after Jupiter's satellite Io, the second-
densest satellite in the Solar System among those 
whose densities are known.
Eclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon 
are all in a straight line (termed "syzygy"). Solar 
eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon 
is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, lunar 
eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between 
the Sun and Moon. The Sun is much larger than the 
Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that 
gives it the same apparent size as the much closer 
and much smaller Moon from the perspective of 
Earth.
Because the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined 
by about 5.145° (5° 9') to the orbit of Earth 
around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full 
and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon 
must be near the intersection of the two orbital 
planes. 
Because the Moon is continuously blocking our view 
of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the 
related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a 
bright star or planet passes behind the Moon      
and is  hidden from view. In this way,             
a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun.

workers. We choose six other languages which rep-
resent a broad range of linguistic phenomena and
have sufﬁciently large Wikipedia. Our annotation
pipeline consists of three main steps:
Step 1) We automatically extract paragraphs
which contain a parallel sentence from articles on
the same topic in each language (left of Figure 1).
Step 2) We employ crowd-workers to annotate
questions and answer spans on the English para-
graphs (centre of Figure 1).
Annotators must
choose answer spans within the parallel source sen-
tence. This allows annotation of questions in the
source language with high probability of being an-
swerable in the target languages, even if the rest of
the context paragraphs are different.
Step 3) We employ professional translators to
translate the questions and to annotate answer spans
in the target language (right of Figure 1).
The following sections describe each step in the
data collection pipeline in more detail.
2.1
Parallel Sentence Mining
Parallel Sentence mining allows us to leverage
naturally-written documents and avoid translation,
which would be expensive and result in potentially
unnatural documents. In order for questions to be
answerable in every target language, we use con-
texts containing an N-way parallel sentence. Our
approach is similar to WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al.,
2019) which extracts parallel sentences for many
language pairs in Wikipedia, but we limit the search

for parallel sentences to documents on the same
topic only, and aim for N-way parallel sentences.
To detect parallel sentences we use the LASER
toolkit,3 which achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in mining parallel sentences (Artetxe and
Schwenk, 2019). LASER uses multilingual sen-
tence embeddings and a distance or margin cri-
terion in the embeddings space to detect parallel
sentences. The reader is referred to Artetxe and
Schwenk (2018) and Artetxe and Schwenk (2019)
for a detailed description. See Appendix A.6 for
further details and statistics on the number of par-
allel sentences mined for all language pairs.
We ﬁrst independently align all languages with
English, then intersect these sets of parallel sen-
tences, forming sets of N-way parallel sentences.
As shown in Table 1, starting with 5.4M parallel
English/German sentences, the number of N-way
parallel sentences quickly decreases as more lan-
guages are added. We also found that 7-way par-
allel sentences lack linguistic diversity, and often
appear in the ﬁrst sentence or paragraph of articles.
As a compromise between language-parallelism

and both the number and diversity of parallel sen-
tences, we use sentences that are 4-way parallel.
This yields 385,396 parallel sentences (see Ap-
pendix A.6) which were sub-sampled to ensure
parallel sentences were evenly distributed in para-
graphs. We ensure that each language combination
is equally represented, so that each language has
many QA instances in common with every other
language. Except for any rejected instances later
in the pipeline, each QA instance will be parallel
between English and three target languages.
2.2
English QA Annotation
We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate En-
glish QA instances, broadly following the method-
ology of Rajpurkar et al. (2016). We present work-
ers with an English aligned sentence, ben along
with the paragraph that contains it cen. Workers
formulate a question qen and highlight the shortest
answer span aen that answers it. aen must be be a
subspan of ben to ensure qen will be answerable in
the target languages. We include a “No Question
Possible” button when no sensible question could
be asked. Screenshots of the annotation interface
can be found in Appendix A.1. The ﬁrst 15 ques-
tions from each worker are manually checked, after
which the worker is contacted with feedback, or
their work is auto-approved.
Once the questions and answers have been anno-
tated, we run another task to re-annotate English
answers. Here, workers are presented with qen and
cen, and requested to generate an a′
en or to indicate
that qen is not answerable. Two additional answer
span annotations are collected for each question.
The additional answer annotations enable us to cal-
culate an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) score.
We calculate the mean token F1 score between the
three answer annotations, giving an IAA score of
82%, comparable to the SQuAD v1.1 development
set, where this IAA measure is 84%.
Rather than provide all three answer annotations
as gold answers, we select a single representative
reference answer. In 88% of cases, either two or
three of the answers exactly matched, so the major-
ity answer is selected. In the remaining cases, the
answer with highest F1 overlap with the other two
is chosen. This results both in an accurate answer
span, and ensures the English results are compara-
ble to those in the target languages, where only one
answer is annotated per question.
We discard instances where annotators marked
the question as unanswerable as well as instances
where over 50% of the question appeared as a sub-
sequence of the aligned sentence, as these are too
easy or of low quality. Finally, we reject questions
where the IAA score was very low (< 0.3) remov-
ing a small number of low quality instances. To
verify we were not discarding challenging but high
quality examples in this step, a manual analysis
of discarded questions was performed. Of these
discarded questions, 38% were poorly speciﬁed,
24% did not make sense/had no answer, 30% had
poor answers, and only 8% were high quality chal-
lenging questions.
2.3
Target Language QA Annotation
We use the One Hour Translation platform to
source professional translators to translate the ques-
tions from English to the six target languages, and
to ﬁnd answers in the target contexts. We present
each translator with the English question qen, En-
glish answer aen, and the context cx (containing
aligned sentence bx) in target language x. The
translators are only shown the aligned sentence and
the sentence on each side (where these exist). This
increases the chance of the question being answer-
able, as in some cases the aligned sentences are
not perfectly parallel, without requiring workers to
read the entire context cx. By providing the English
answer we try to minimize cultural and personal
differences in the amount of detail in the answer.
We sample 2% of the translated questions for
additional review by language experts. Transla-
tors that did not meet the quality standards were
removed from the translator pool, and their transla-
tions were reallocated. By comparing the distribu-
tion of answer lengths relative to the context to the
English distribution, some cases were found where
some annotators selected very long answers, espe-
cially for Chinese. We clariﬁed the instructions
with these speciﬁc annotators, and send such cases
for re-annotation. We discard instances in target
languages where annotators indicate there is no an-
swer in that language. This means some instances
are not 4-way parallel. “No Answer” annotations
occurred for 6.6%-21.9% of instances (Vietnamese
and German, respectively). We release the “No An-
swer” data separately as an additional resource, but
do not consider it in our experiments or analysis.

Monolingual QA Data
There is a great vari-
ety of English QA data, popularized by MCTest
(Richardson, 2013), CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann
et al., 2015) CBT (Hill et al., 2016), and Wik-
iQA (Yang et al., 2015) amongst others. Large
span-based datasets such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016, 2018), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017),
NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017), and Natural Ques-
tions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) have seen extrac-
tive QA become a dominant paradigm. However,
large, high-quality datasets in other languages are
relatively rare. There are several Chinese datasets,
such as DUReader (He et al., 2018), CMRC (Cui
et al., 2019b) and DRCD (Shao et al., 2018). More
recently, there have been efforts to build corpora in
a wider array of languages, such as Korean (Lim
et al., 2019) and Arabic (Mozannar et al., 2019).
Cross-lingual QA Modelling
Cross-lingual QA
as a discipline has been explored in QA for RDF
data for a number of years, such as the QALD-3
and 5 tracks (Cimiano et al., 2013; Unger et al.,
2015), with more recent work from Zimina et al.
(2018). Lee et al. (2018) explore an approach to
use English QA data from SQuAD to improve QA
performance in Korean using an in-language seed
dataset. Kumar et al. (2019) study question gener-
ation by leveraging English questions to generate
better Hindi questions, and Lee and Lee (2019) and
Cui et al. (2019a) develop modelling approaches to
improve performance on Chinese QA tasks using
English resources. Lee et al. (2019) and Hsu et al.
(2019) explore modelling approaches for zero-shot
transfer and Singh et al. (2019) explore how train-
ing with cross-lingual data regularizes QA models.
Cross-lingual QA Data
Gupta et al. (2018) re-
lease a parallel QA dataset in English and Hindi,
Hardalov et al. (2019) investigate QA transfer
from English to Bulgarian, Liu et al. (2019b) re-
lease a cloze QA dataset in Chinese and English,
and Jing et al. (2019) released BiPar, built using
parallel paragraphs from novels in English and
Chinese. These datasets have a similar spirit to
MLQA, but are limited to two languages. Asai et al.
(2018) investigate extractive QA on a manually-
translated set of 327 SQuAD instances in Japanese
and French, and develop a phrase-alignment mod-
elling technique, showing improvements over back-
translation.
Like us, they build multi-way par-
allel extractive QA data, but MLQA has many
more instances, covers more languages and does
not require manual document translation.
Liu
et al. (2019a) explore cross-lingual open-domain
QA with a dataset built from Wikipedia “Did you
know?” questions, covering nine languages. Un-
like MLQA, it is distantly supervised, the dataset
size varies by language, instances are not paral-
lel, and answer distributions vary by language,
making quantitative comparisons across languages
challenging. Finally, in contemporaneous work,
Artetxe et al. (2019) release XQuAD, a dataset of

Table 4, MLQA covers 7 languages, but contains
more data per language – over 5k QA pairs from

Wikipedia contexts rather than manual translation.
Aggregated
Cross-lingual
Benchmarks
Re-
cently, following the widespread adoption of
projects such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2019), there
have been efforts to compile a suite of high quality
multilingual tasks as a uniﬁed benchmark system.
Two such projects, XGLUE (Liang et al., 2020) and
XTREME (Hu et al., 2020) incorporate MLQA as
part of their aggregated benchmark.

Cross-lingual QA Experiments
We introduce two tasks to assess cross-lingual QA
performance with MLQA. The ﬁrst, cross-lingual
transfer (XLT), requires training a model with
(cx, qx, ax) training data in language x, in our case
English. Development data in language x is used
for tuning. At test time, the model must extract
answer ay in language y given context cy and ques-
tion qy. The second task, generalized cross-lingual
transfer (G-XLT), is trained in the same way, but
at test time the model must extract az from cz in
language z given qy in language y. This evaluation
setup is possible because MLQA is highly parallel,
allowing us to swap qz for qy for parallel instances
without changing the question’s meaning.
As MLQA only has development and test data,
we adopt SQuAD v1.1 as training data. We use
MLQA-en as development data, and focus on zero-
shot evaluation, where no training or development
data is available in target languages. Models were
trained with the SQuAD-v1 training method from
Devlin et al. (2019) and implemented in Pytext (Aly
et al., 2018). We establish a number of baselines to
assess current cross-lingual QA capabilities:
Translate-Train
We translate instances from the
SQuAD training set into the target language us-
ing machine-translation.4 Before translating, we
enclose answers in quotes, as in Lee et al. (2018).
This makes it easy to extract answers from trans-
lated contexts, and encourages the translation
model to map answers into single spans. We dis-
card instances where this fails (∼5%). This corpus
is then used to train a model in the target language.
Translate-Test
The context and question in the
target language is translated into English at test
time. We use our best English model to produce
an answer span in the translated paragraph. For
all languages other than Hindi,5 we use attention

5Alignments were unavailable for Hindi-English due to
production model limitations. Instead we translate English

scores, aij, from the translation model to map the
answer back to the original language. Rather than
aligning spans by attention argmax, as by Asai et al.
(2018), we identify the span in the original context
which maximizes F1 score with the English span:
RC = P
i∈Se,j∈So aij
 P
i∈Se ai∗
PR = P
i∈Se,j∈So aij
 P
j∈So a∗j
F1 = 2 ∗RC ∗PR

RC + PR
answer = arg max
So
F1(So)
(1)
where Se and So are the English and original spans
respectively, ai∗= P
j aij and a∗j = P
i a∗j.
Cross-lingual Representation Models
We pro-
duce zero-shot transfer results from multilingual
BERT (cased, 104 languages) (Devlin et al., 2019)
and XLM (MLM + TLM, 15 languages) (Lample
and Conneau, 2019). Models are trained with the
SQuAD training set and evaluated directly on the
MLQA test set in the target language. Model se-
lection is also constrained to be strictly zero-shot,
using only English development data to pick hyper-
parameters. As a result, we end up with a single
model that we test for all 7 languages.
4.1
Evaluation Metrics for Multilingual QA
Most extractive QA tasks use Exact Match (EM)
and mean token F1 score as performance metrics.
The widely-used SQuAD evaluation also performs
the following answer-preprocessing operations: i)
lowercasing, ii) stripping (ASCII) punctuation iii)
stripping (English) articles and iv) whitespace to-
kenisation. We introduce the following modiﬁca-
tions for fairer multilingual evaluation: Instead of
stripping ASCII punctuation, we strip all unicode
characters with a punctuation General Category.6
When a language has stand-alone articles (English,
Spanish, German and Vietnamese) we strip them.
We use whitespace tokenization for all MLQA lan-
guages other than Chinese, where we use the mixed
segmentation method from Cui et al. (2019b).

Results
5.1
XLT Results
Table 5 shows the results on the XLT task. XLM
performs best overall, transferring best in Span-
answers using another round of translation. Back-translated
answers may not map back to spans in the original context, so
this Translate-Test performs poorly.
6http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/
tr44-4.html#General_Category_Values
Figure 3: F1 score stratiﬁed by English wh* word, rel-
ative to overall F1 score for XLM
ish, German and Arabic, and competitively with
translate-train+M-BERT for Vietnamese and Chi-
nese. XLM is however, weaker in English. Even
for XLM, there is a 39.8% drop in mean EM score
(20.9% F1) over the English BERT-large baseline,
showing signiﬁcant room for improvement. All
models generally struggle on Arabic and Hindi.
A manual analysis of cases where XLM failed to
exactly match the gold answer was carried out for
all languages. 39% of these errors were completely
wrong answers, 5% were annotation errors and
7% were acceptable answers with no overlap with
the gold answer. The remaining 49% come from
answers that partially overlap with the gold span.
The variation of errors across languages was small.
To see how performance varies by question type,
we compute XLM F1 scores stratiﬁed by common
English wh-words. Figure 3 shows that “When”
questions are the easiest for all languages, and
“Where” questions seem challenging in most target
languages. Further details are in Appendix A.3.
To explore whether questions that were difﬁcult
for the model in English were also challenging in
the target languages, we split MLQA into two sub-
sets on whether the XLM model got an English
F1 score of zero. Figure 4 shows that transfer per-
formance is better when the model answers well
in English, but is far from zero when the English
answer is wrong, suggesting some questions may
be easier to answer in some languages than others.

G-XLT Results
Table 6 shows results for XLM on the G-XLT task.7
For questions in a given language, the model per-
forms best when the context language matches the
question, except for Hindi and Arabic. For con-

English Results on SQuAD 1 and MLQA
The MLQA-en results in Table 5 are lower than re-
ported results on SQuAD v1.1 in the literature for
equivalent models. However, once SQuAD scores
are adjusted to reﬂect only having one answer an-
notation (picked using the same method used to
pick MLQA answers), the discrepancy drops to
5.8% on average (see Table 7). MLQA-en con-
texts are on average 28% longer than SQuAD’s,
and MLQA covers a much wider set of articles
than SQuAD. Minor differences in preprocessing
and answer lengths may also contribute (MLQA-
en answers are slightly longer, 3.1 tokens vs 2.9
on average). Question type distributions are very
similar in both datasets (Figure 7 in Appendix A)

Discussion
It is worth discussing the quality of context para-
graphs in MLQA. Our parallel sentence mining
approach can source independently-written docu-
ments in different languages, but, in practice, arti-
cles are often translated from English to the target
languages by volunteers. Thus our method some-
times acts as an efﬁcient mechanism of sourcing
existing human translations, rather than sourcing
independently-written content on the same topic.
The use of machine translation is strongly discour-
aged by the Wikipedia community,8 but from exam-
ining edit histories of articles in MLQA, machine
translation is occasionally used as an article seed,
before being edited and added to by human authors.
Our annotation method restricts answers to come
from speciﬁed sentences. Despite being provided
several sentences of context, some annotators may
be tempted to only read the parallel sentence
and write questions which only require a single
sentence of context to answer. However, single
sentence context questions are a known issue in
SQuAD annotation in general (Sugawara et al.,
2018) suggesting our method would not result in
less challenging questions, supported by scores on
MLQA-en being similar to SQuAD (section 5.3).
MLQA is partitioned into development and test
splits. As MLQA is parallel, this means there is de-
velopment data for every language. Since MLQA
will be freely available, this was done to reduce the
risk of test data over-ﬁtting in future, and to estab-

lish standard splits. However, in our experiments,
we only make use of the English development data
and study strict zero-shot settings. Other evalua-
tion setups could be envisioned, e.g. by exploiting
the target language development sets for hyper-
parameter optimisation or ﬁne-tuning, which could
be fruitful for higher transfer performance, but we
leave such “few-shot” experiments as future work.
Other potential areas to explore involve training
datasets other than English, such as CMRC (Cui
et al., 2018), or using unsupervised QA techniques
to assist transfer (Lewis et al., 2019).
Finally, a large body of work suggests QA mod-
els are over-reliant on word-matching between
question and context (Jia and Liang, 2017; Gan and
Ng, 2019). G-XLT represents an interesting test-
bed, as simple symbolic matching is less straight-
forward when questions and contexts use different
languages. However, the performance drop from
XLT is relatively small (8.2 mean F1), suggesting
word-matching in cross-lingual models is more nu-
anced and robust than it may initially appear.

Conclusion
We have introduced MLQA, a highly-parallel mul-
tilingual QA benchmark in seven languages. We
developed several baselines on two cross-lingual
understanding tasks on MLQA with state-of-the-art
methods, and demonstrate signiﬁcant room for im-
provement. We hope that MLQA will help to catal-
yse work in cross-lingual QA to close the gap be-
tween training and testing language performance.

Annotation Interface
Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the annotation inter-
face. Workers are asked to write a question in the
box, and highlight an answer using the mouse in the
sentence that is in bold. There are a number of data
input validation features to assist workers, as well
as detailed instructions in a drop-down window,
which are shown in Figure 6
A.2
Additional MLQA Statistics
Figure 7 shows the distribution of wh words in ques-
tions in both MLQA-en and SQuAD v.1.1. The
distributions are very similar, suggesting training
on SQuAD data is an appropriate training dataset
choice.
Table 4 shows the number of Wikipedia articles
that feature at least one of their paragraphs as a con-
text paragraph in MLQA, along with the number of
unique context paragraphs in MLQA. There are 1.9
context paragraphs from each article on average.
This is in contrast to SQuAD, which instead fea-
tures a small number of curated articles, but more
densely annotated, with 43 context paragraphs per
article on average. Thus, MLQA covers a much
broader range of topics than SQuAD.
Table 8 shows statistics about the lengths of con-
texts, questions and answers in MLQA. Vietnamese
has the longest contexts on average and German
are shortest, but all languages have a substantial
tail of long contexts. Other than Chinese, answers
are on average 3 to 4 tokens.

QA Performance stratiﬁed by question
and answer types
To examine how performance varies across lan-
guages for different types of questions, we stratify
MLQA with three criteria — By English Wh-word,
by answer Named-Entity type and by English Ques-
tion Difﬁculty
By wh-word:
First, we split by the English Wh*
word in the question. This resulting change in F1

Table 8: Mean Sequence lengths (tokens) in MLQA.
*calculated with mixed segmentation (section 4.1)
score compared to the overall F1 score is shown
in Figure 3, and discussed brieﬂy in the main text.
The English wh* word provides a clue as to the type
of answer the questioner is expecting, and thus acts
as a way of classifying QA instances into types.
We chose the 5 most common wh* words in the
dataset for this analysis. We see that “when” ques-
tions are consistently easier than average across
the languages, but the pattern is less clear for other
question types. ”Who” questions also seem easier
than average, except for Hindi, where the perfor-
mance is quite low for these questions. “How”-type
questions (such as “how much”, “how many” or
“how long” ) are also more challenging to answer
than average in English compared to the other lan-
guages. “Where” questions also seem challenging
for Spanish, German, Chinese and Hindi, but this
is not true for Arabic or Vietnamese.
By Named-Entity type
We create subsets of
MLQA by detecting which English named enti-
ties are contained in the answer span. To achieve
this, we run Named Entity Recognition using
SPaCy (Honnibal and Montani, 2017), and de-
tect where named entity spans overlap with an-
swer spans. The F1 scores for different answer
types relative to overall F1 score are shown for
various Named Entity types in Figure 8. There
Figure 8: F1 score stratiﬁed by named entity types in
answer spans, relative to overall F1 score for XLM
are some clear trends: Answer spans that contain
named entities are easier to answer than those that
do not (the ﬁrst two rows) for all the languages,
but the difference is most pronounced for Ger-
man. Secondly,“Temporal” answer types (DATE
and TIME entity labels) are consistently easier
than average for all languages, consistent with the
high scores for “when” questions in the previous
section. Again, this result is most pronounced
in German, but is also very strong for Spanish,
Hindi, and Vietnamese.
Arabic also performs
well for ORG, GPE and LOC answer types, unlike
most of the other languages. Numeric questions
(CARDINAL, ORDINAL, PERCENT, QUANTITY
and MONEY entity labels) also seem relatively easy
for the model in most languages.
By English Question Difﬁculty
Here, we split
MLQA into two subsets, according to whether the
XLM model got the question completely wrong (no
word overlap with the correct answer). We then
evaluated the mean F1 score for each language on
the two subsets, with the results shown in Figure
4. We see that questions that are “easy” in English
also seem to be easier in the target languages, but
the drop in performance for the “hard” subset is
not as dramatic as one might expect. This suggests
that not all questions that are hard in English in
MLQA are hard in the target languages. This could
be due to the grammar and morphology of differ-
ent languages leading to questions being easier or
more difﬁcult to answer, but an another factor is
that context documents can be shorter in target lan-


## Page 15


guages for questions the model struggled to answer
correctly in English, effectively making them eas-
ier. Manual inspection suggests that whilst context
documents are often shorter for when the model
is correct in the target language, this effect is not
sufﬁcient to explain the difference in performance.
A.4
Additional G-XLT results
Table 6 in the main text shows for XLM on the
G-XLT task, and Table 9 for Multilingual-BERT
respectively. XLM outperforms M-BERT for most
language pairs, with a mean G-XLT performance of
53.4 F1 compared to 47.2 F1 (mean of off-diagonal
elements of Tables 6 and 9). Multilingual BERT ex-
hibits more of a preference for English than XLM
for G-XLT, and exhibits a bigger performance drop
going from XLT to G-XLT (10.5 mean drop in F1
compared to 8.2).

Further details on Parallel Sentence
mining
Table 10 shows the number of mined parallel sen-
tences found in each language, as function of how
many languages the sentences are parallel between.
As the number of languages that a parallel sen-
tence is shared between increases, the number of
such sentences decreases. When we look for 7-way
aligned examples, we only ﬁnd 1340 sentences
from the entirety of the 7 Wikipedia. Additionally,
most of these sentences are the ﬁrst sentence of
the article, or are uninteresting. However, if we
choose 4-way parallel sentences, there are plenty
of sentences to choose from. We sample evenly
from each combination of English and 3 of the 6
target languages. This ensures that we have an even
distribution over all the target languages, as well as
ensuring we have even numbers of instances that
will be parallel between target language combina-
tions.
