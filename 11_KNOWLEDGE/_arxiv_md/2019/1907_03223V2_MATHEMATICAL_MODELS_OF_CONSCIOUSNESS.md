Abstract. In recent years, promising mathematical models have been suggested
which aim to describe conscious experience and its relation to the physical domain.
Whereas the axioms and metaphysical ideas of these theories have been carefully
motivated, their mathematical formalism has not. In this article we aim to remedy
this situation. We give an account of what warrants mathematical representation of
phenomenal experience, derive a general mathematical framework which takes into
account consciousness’ epistemic context and study which mathematical structures
some of the key characteristics of conscious experience imply, showing precisely where
mathematical approaches allow to go beyond what the standard methodology can
do. The result is a general mathematical framework for models of consciousness that
can be employed in the theory-building process.

1. Introduction
Conscious experience and its relation to the physical domain has been studied by
philosophers, theologians and scientists over many centuries [Faw14]. In the previous
three decades, there has been a resurgence of scientiﬁc investigations. Groundbreaking
developments in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy lead to the
emergence of a dedicated science of cosnciousness, whose aim is to develop a scientiﬁc
account of conscious experience and its relation to the physical domain (e.g. brain
processes).
A model of consciousness is a hypothetical theory about how conscious experience
and the physical domain relate [Set07]. Examples include Global Workspace Theo-
ries [DKC98, Baa05], Multiple Draft Theory [Den93], Higher Order Thought Theo-
ries [Car16] or Integrated Information Theory [OAT14], among many others. Models
of consciousness complement metaphysical theories of consciousness, such as the vari-
ous forms of functionalism, identity theories, interactive dualisms or neutral monisms.
These theories are concerned primarily with ontological questions and address the
general type of relation between consciousness and the physical domain.
The rising importance of mathematics in consciousness studies. In recent
years, many models of consciousness have been proposed which are mathematical
in nature.
Primary examples in neuroscience are the recent versions of Integrated
Information Theory [OAT14, MMA+18, HT19], which aim to determine the qual-
ity and quantity of a system’s conscious experience using a complex mathematical
algorithm [KT20, TK20], or Predictive Processing Theory [MW], which can be in-
terpreted as specifying the content of conscious experience of a system using an ad-
vanced minimization principle [DD20]. But promising models have been proposed by
other disciplines as well, including philosophy [CM21], physics [Ken18, Ken19], math-
ematics [Pen94, KR15a, Mas16] or psychology [HP14], all based on various diﬀerent
metaphysical ideas about consciousness.
These developments point at an increasing relevance of mathematical tools and
methods in the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, much like in other scientiﬁc disciplines
throughout the last century, with promising new insights on the horizon. However,
mathematization on its own does not have unique scientiﬁc merit. Valuable progress
can only be made if the mathematization is based on and integrates previous theoret-
ical, empirical and conceptual work.
What makes consciousness a problem. Consciousness is a phenomenon unlike
any other studied by natural science. It is unique as an object of investigation both in
its characteristic features and in its epistemic context. This is true in particular for its
most relevant and mysterious connotation, which much of the science of consciousness
and also this article is concerned with, namely phenomenal consciousness. Phenomenal

consciousness refers to the way in which the world appears to us, i.e.
the way in
which we experience the world. This can roughly be paraphrased as “pure subjective
experience” [Met95b].
Much of philosophy of mind is concerned with analysing in detail just what the
characteristic features of phenomenal consciousness are and how precisely they relate
to metaphysical ideas and eﬀorts of scientiﬁc investigation. The arguably most crucial
features attributed to phenomenal experience are its essential subjective nature, which
sometimes is taken to mean that phenomenal consciousness embodies a particular point
of view [Nag74], but also that some of its parts or properties seem ineﬀable [Lew29],
private, or unavailable to cognitive and linguistic processing or communication [Met07].
Basic properties or simple constituents of phenomenal consciousness are called qualia,
but this term is being used with many diﬀerent connotations to date.
Qualia are
variously claimed to be intrinsic and non-relational or to have a qualitative and non-
quantiﬁable nature. Phenomenal consciousness is also claimed to be directly or im-
mediately apprehensible, to be transparent in the sense that it appears as if we are
in direct contact with the content of our conscious experience or to be homogeneous
[Met95b]. Various diﬀerent connotations of all of these notions exist, and diﬀerent
philosophers endorse various combinations thereof.
Complementing these characteristic features of consciousness is its unique epistemic
context, which comes about from the fact that phenomenal consciousness per se is
accessible only to the experiencing system itself. Thus in any scientiﬁc approach there
are two fundamentally diﬀerent methodological approaches that allow one to gather
information, a ﬁrst person perspective and a third person perspective. This is referred
to as the epistemic asymmetry of consciousness [Met95a].
The need for a mathematical foundation. Any scientiﬁc analysis which strives
to address and explain phenomenal consciousness needs to take these features of con-
sciousness into account, at the very least as providing epistemic restrictions which
constrain and shape the empirical access to conscious experience. Failing to do so at
all amounts to ignoring what makes consciousness a problem in the ﬁrst place, which
no serious scientiﬁc investigation can aﬀord.
To date, almost none of the existing formal models take any of these properties
of consciousness into account. While mathematical structures are quickly associated
with terms like ‘qualia’, ‘subjective experience’ or ‘act of consciousness’, contemporary
models fall short of actually considering the conceptual meaning of these philosophical
concepts.
What is necessary to mend this is a thorough foundation of mathematical models of
consciousness that analyses which implications the various characteristics of conscious
experience have on the mathematical structure of these models and which provides
a precise account of how the concepts developed in philosophy of mind relate to the
mathematical structure of models of consciousness.
The goal of the work presented in this article is to provide this foundation for the case
of ineﬀability, privateness and cognitive, linguistic and communicative unavailability.
A framework for formulating models of consciousness. The result of this work
is a general mathematical framework in which models of consciousness can be formu-
lated. Much like Lagrangian mechanics in theoretical physics, it does not provide any
particular law or equation which constitutes a model of consciousness, but rather a

general formal machinery. What this machinery achieves is to properly take into ac-
count that conscious experience has ineﬀable, private or inaccessible aspects and that
it exhibits an epistemic asymmetry. This framework provides a ﬁrst mathematical
foundation for models of consciousness, and needs to be expanded in future work to
take other key characteristics into account.
Crucially, the framework is independent of whether one considers any of these char-
acteristic features to be ontological in origin or simply due to a system’s particular
design or cognitive functions [Den93].
What matters, from the perspective of this
framework, are only the epistemic restrictions that arise from these features of con-
scious experience, i.e. that access to some parts of conscious experience is limited by
consciousness’ subjective nature and by ineﬀability, privateness and inaccessibility in
any type of experimental situation.
Thus this framework can be dubbed operational. Much like Quantum Theory in its
conventional formulation, it takes as its starting point the prototypical experimental
situation in which a theory (of consciousness) is being tested, used or inferred, and
then adds the particular epistemic context of consciousness, so as to arrive at a general
operational description. Great care has been taken to keep the mathematical structure
of this formalism as general as possible, and to provide operational justiﬁcations of all
essential deﬁnitions, so as to ensure that the framework is compatible with all types
of mathematical structure one would want to use in modelling consciousness, includ-
ing category theory [TK20, TTS16], information theory [Ton08] or complex system
approaches [Atm16], among many others.
An axiomatic conceptual underpinning. In order to translate any concept into
formalism, the concept itself needs to be rigorously deﬁned. To date, neither the term
qualia, nor the concepts of ineﬀability, privateness and inaccessibility are deﬁned in a
rigorous enough manner to warrant thorough formalization.
Thus in order to achieve our goal, it was necessary to represent the underlying
philosophical concepts in an axiomatic form that is suitable for formalization. Since
this whole programme is operational in nature, it suﬃces in fact to provide an ax-
iomatic deﬁnition of the operational consequences of these characteristic features of
consciousness.
For the case of ineﬀability, privateness and inaccessibility this is possible at once by
introducing the concept of non-collatability: A part, property or feature of conscious
experience is non-collatable if there do not exist any reasonable means to identify
this part, property or feature over several experiencing subjects in an experimental
trail. Non-collatability is entailed by ineﬀability, privateness and inaccessibility and
arguably also by consciousness’ subjective nature. As shown in detail throughout this
work, it is precisely non-collatability which generates much of the epistemic diﬃculty
in investigating conscious experience, and which has substantial consequences for any
empirically adequate model of consciousness.
The conceptual deﬁnitions we have derived in order to found the mathematical
structure of models of consciousness give rise to an axiomatic grounding of the scien-
tiﬁc study of consciousness that is an alternative to and further development of the
grounding that derives from David Chalmers’ work. While our grounding was pri-
marily intended to constitute an intermediate construction which links philosophical
concepts and mathematical formalism, it may also have some conceptual worth in its

own, providing an interim way to conceive of the task and methodology of the scientiﬁc
study of consciousness from a more formal perspective.
A new way of consciousness science. In summary, this article can be understood
as taking seriously a new way of doing consciousness science that has been pioneered
in eminent works such as [OAT14], [HP14] or [Res18]. Its central idea is to represent
phenomenal consciousness in terms mathematical spaces, and to use these spaces to
build theories of how conscious experience might relate to the physical domain. This
facilitates a much richer and reﬁned way of addressing conscious experience and of-
fers promising tools to resolve of some of the key issues that permeate contemporary
consciousness studies.
What this article adds to this new methodology is the requirement that the essential
features of conscious experience, studied in detail by philosophy of mind, are taken
into account when building this mathematical representation. Doing so requires an
account of how precisely mathematical spaces can be grounded in the phenomenol-
ogy of experience and of which mathematical implication consciousness’ fundamental
epistemological context has. Answers to all of these questions are proposed here. The
hope is that these considerations might provide a useful basis for further development
of formal models of consciousness.
The structure of this article. This article is structured as follows. In order to make
it accessible to readers without formal background, we ﬁrst summarize the results in
Section 2, keeping mathematical details to a minimum. In this section, we also explain
in detail the rationale and motivation of this work.
All subsequent sections aim for a concise presentation of deﬁnitions, explanations
and examples. In Section 3, we give the conceptual deﬁnitions on which our frame-
work rests, making as few assumptions as necessary. This gives rise to an axiomatic
grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness. In Section 4, we show that there
is an explanatory gap between qualia as deﬁned here and natural science. Section 5
is devoted to deriving a general mathematical framework for formal models of con-
sciousness, making use of a minimal set of ingredients of any formal theory and of
consciousness’ epistemic asymmetry. In Section 6, ﬁnally, we show how consciousness’
characteristic features can be taken into account. We conclude this paper with a brief
remark on a metaphysical question in Section 7 and various examples in Section 8.
In Appendix A, we review the grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness that
derives from David Chalmers’ work in [Cha96, Cha10], emphasizing the logical relations
among its parts. In Appendix B, we discuss problems that arise if one attempts to
apply this grounding in a model-building process.
2. Summary of Results
Any research activity directed at conscious experience presupposes a conception
of the phenomenon that is to be studied and a conception of a methodology that is
suitable to do so. We call this a grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness contains at least
- an explicit deﬁnition of what is to be studied.
- an explicit outline of the methodology.1

those who work in some ﬁeld” [Wik18b], “a system of methods used in a particular area of study or

Much of the research devoted to consciousness in the previous two decades has been
guided by a grounding that derives from David Chalmers’ work [Cha96]. This ground-
ing has played a pivotal role in the creation and consolidation of the ﬁeld. However,
it also exhibits several severe problems when being applied (Appendix B). In the ﬁrst
part of this paper, we introduce an alternative to Chalmers’ grounding of the scientiﬁc
study of consciousness. This alternative is built on a thoroughly operational perspective,
which means that we deﬁne all notions relative to prototypical experimental investi-
gations.
Any experimental situation devoted to study conscious experience presupposes a
preliminary choice of organisms that are considered to be conscious, and whose con-
scious experience and physical state is probed during the experiment in order to gain
information about how consciousness relates to the physical domain. We denote any
such class of organisms by C and call them experiencing subjects. Taking the oper-
ational perspective seriously, we consider C to be a primitive notion. While it may
be guided by theoretical insights and changed over the course of time, at any partic-
ular time a class C provides the basis for both inference and tests of theories about
consciousness.
Having chosen our primitive notion, we can deﬁne experience relative to it.
A
promising choice is to use somewhat phenomenological terminology in deﬁning the term
conscious experience, referring to the totality of how experience ‘reveals itself’ to an
experiencing subject, how the experiencing subject ﬁnds itself experiencing, or how the
‘the world’ appears to it. While this is what we have in mind, we have opted for more
approachable terminology and deﬁne the term conscious experience to denote totality
of impressions, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, etc.
which an experiencing subject
lives through at a particular instant of time (Deﬁnition 3.1). Experience so deﬁned
has various diﬀerent aspects, where we deﬁne the term ‘aspect’ to be a placeholder for
any conception like ‘part’, ‘property’ or ‘element of’ (Deﬁnition 3.2).
The key notion on which our grounding is built is that of non-collatability.
An
aspect of experience is non-collatable if there is no reasonable method to identify
whether two or more experiencing subjects in an experiment experience this very
aspect of experience. In other words, if the identity of this aspect over several diﬀerent
experiencing subjects in C cannot be determined (Deﬁnition 3.5).
The distinction between collatable and non-collatable aspects of experience is what
replaces the distinction between phenomenological and psychological concepts of mind
in [Cha96]. Whereas the latter distinction is deﬁned in terms causal roles and spa-
tiotemporal structure (cf. Appendix A), our distinction is deﬁned axiomatically in
terms of phenomenological or operational notions.
What is crucial is that non-collatability is implied by various essential characteristic
features of conscious experience. E.g., any aspect which appears to be ineﬀable (i.e.
which is experienced as ineﬀable) is also non-collatable in the above sense. The same is
true for aspects of experience which are experienced as private or which are not avail-
able to cognitive or linguistic processing. All of these characteristic features destroy the
possibility to identify an aspect under consideration over several experiencing subjects.
Non-collatability is a necessary operational consequence of all of these characteristic
features.
activity” [Oxf18]. In particular, the methodology includes the speciﬁcation of what constitutes an
experiment. The term ‘grounding’ is one of several translations of the German word “Grundlegung”.

The same may be true of subjectivity of conscious experience, if taken to warrant the
claim that “there are facts that do not consist in the truth of propositions expressible
in a human language” [Nag74, p. 441]. In fact, one of the main claims in [Nag74] is that
there is at present no conception that allows one to establish the identity of a ‘what it
is like’ aspect of experience with a physical state. Our starting point, non-collatability,
is closely related to this claim and may even be implied by it in reasonable cases.
Building on non-collatability, we deﬁne qualia as follows.2
Deﬁnition 3.9 We deﬁne the term qualia to refer to all non-collatable aspects of
experience of an experiencing subject within the class C.
This deﬁnition is warranted since it includes the paradigmatic examples of what
qualia are claimed to be (Example 3.10), as well as aspects of experience referenced
by the Nagelian ‘what it is like’ conception (Example 3.11).
It is furthermore ax-
iomatic and replaces the concept of phenomenal consciousness as deﬁned in Chalmers’
grounding.3
The aspects of experience which satisfy Deﬁnition 3.9 are of special interest because
the non-collatability induces a fundamental diﬃculty in any scientiﬁc approach: It
implies that these aspects cannot be referenced intersubjectively, which in turn implies
that they cannot be referenced in a scientiﬁc model or empirical analysis. There is
a fundamental explanatory gap (Section 4).
The goal of this paper, when put in
these terms, is to develop a mathematical framework that allows us to address both
collatable and non-collatable aspects of experience, providing a formal methodology
suitable to address this explanatory gap.
Next, we make use of the central idea that underlies many contemporary mathe-
matical models of consciousness: To represent phenomenal consciousness as a mathe-
matical space. In order to provide an accurate method to do so, we make use of two
phenomenological axioms.
First, we make use of the fact that both collatable and non-collatable aspects of
experience can be recognized to a certain extent (Phenomenological Axiom 3.12). An-
other way to say this is that aspects of experience may be experienced as identical.
Following our operational perspective, this warrants the introduction of labels for both
qualia and collatable aspects of experience, i.e.
names relative to an experiencing
subject.
Second, we make use of the fact that there are collatable relations between aspects
of experience (Phenomenological Axiom 3.14). This might be considered obvious in
the case of collatable aspects of experience. With respect to non-collatable aspects of
experience, it corresponds to the observation that “structural features of perception
might be more accessible to objective description, even though something would be
left out” [Nag74, p. 449], or that “even if experiences are in some sense ‘ineﬀable,’
relations between experiences are not; we have no trouble discussing these relations,
whether they be relations of similarity and diﬀerence, geometric relations, relations of
intensity, and so on. As Schlick [Sch38] pointed out, the form of experience seems to be
2 Note that the numbering of this and all following deﬁnitions is chosen according to the main body
of this article.
3We remark that for this and all other deﬁnitions, it does not matter whether non-collatability or
any of the characteristic features which imply it are considered to be fundamental or merely the result
of a system’s architecture. All that matters is that experience appears as such.

straightforwardly communicable, even if the content (intrinsic quality) is not” [Cha96,
p. 224].
Together, these two phenomenological observations allow us to deﬁne a mathemati-
cal space that represents conscious experience, which we call experience space E. The
elements of this space are not experiences themselves but labels that an experiencing
subject may give for his/her aspects of experience, and the mathematical structure
on this set of labels is induced by the collatable relations between aspects of experi-
ence. To conceive of E as space of labels, rather than as a space of experiences, is
of advantage because it prevents from the very beginning any implicit assumption of
well-deﬁned reference to aspects of experience. In contrast, working with a space whose
elements are intended to express experiences themselves requires the introduction of
a map which describes how these experiences can be inferred from reports (labels),
e.g. as in [KH20]. The details of our introduction of experience space are explained in
Section 3.2, and various examples are given in Section 3.5.
We remark that whereas our constructions are guided by conceiving of labels as
something that an experiencing subject can express, which requires C to comprise
humans, this is not necessary. This is to because the various principles that are used
in experiments to date to infer the state of consciousness of some subject (e.g. button
presses or behavioural indicators) are, in our terminology, in fact means to infer labels
of aspects of experience. Whether a label is a recorded word or some other type of
report, such as a particular movement, does not matter for our purposes. What is
crucial about the terminology of labels is that one avoids from the very beginning any
implicit assumption that there is an empirically well-deﬁned method to refer to qualia
of an experiencing subject.
Non-collatability implies limitations on how aspects of experience can be referenced
in a theory or empirical investigation.
Whereas labels of collatable aspects of ex-
perience can be synchronized over all experiencing subjects in the class C (because
collatability holds iﬀthere exist means to identify), labels of qualia cannot. In virtue
of non-collatability, the deﬁnition of qualia implies that any label which one experienc-
ing subject uses to denote a quale may denote another quale in a diﬀerent experiencing
subject. Any scientiﬁc investigation which aims to address qualia needs to take the
resulting ambiguity into account. Ignoring it will lead to errors, such as the study of
the wrong “information pathway” or confounding neural correlates of external signals
with neural correlates of qualia.
In the next step of our construction, we quantify this ambiguity precisely. To this
end, we make use of the mathematical representation E of experience constructed
previously. As we explained in detail in Section 3.3, the conceptual and mathematical
deﬁnitions imply that the ambiguity of any reference to aspects of experience can be
stated concisely in terms of the automorphism group Aut(E) of E, i.e. the group of
all transformations of E which change labels in such a way that the mathematical
structure of E is left invariant.
We ﬁnd that any statement about conscious experience that uses an individual
label e could, in light of non-collatability, have equally well be formulated in terms of
any label e′ that is part of a subset [e] of labels. This subset [e] is called the equivalence
class of the label e with respect to the automorphism group Aut(E).
The crucial insight here is that these equivalence classes describe what is intersub-
jectively accessible or, in our terminology, empirically well-deﬁned. Taken together,


## Page 9

these equivalence classes describe what is amenable to the usual scientiﬁc methodol-
ogy. Depending on the mathematical structure of E, this may well include some of
the non-collatable aspects of experience.
This second step in our constructions may be suﬃcient for many investigations once
experimental tools become advanced enough to proceed to the study of individual
aspects of experience. It enables experimentalists to use structural features of phe-
nomenal experience, as represented in E, to push the boundary of ineﬀability and all
the other characteristic features that imply non-collatability back a little bit. However,
as long as there are equivalence classes [e] which contain more than one label, there
are questions that evade the reach of the standard scientiﬁc methodology: Why the
subject had one of the corresponding experience rather than the other. Even though
this cannot be expressed by intersubjective means, there is a fact to the matter for
the experiencing subject, and hence a priori an open scientiﬁc question. The goal of
the remaining part of the article is to develop tools that allow us to address this open
question.
To develop these tools, we have to go beyond the mathematical representation of
experience, and in fact consider formal hypotheses about how conscious experience
relates to the physical domain, i.e. formal models of consciousness. In order to remain
as general as possible, as a ﬁrst step in answering this question, we ask what the most
general mathematical structure is that a model of consciousness needs to address.
In order to answer this question, we ﬁrst give an account of the minimally suﬃcient
formal structure of any scientiﬁc theory (Section 5.1).
A theory needs to specify
some dynamical variables d that describe what the theory intends to address, may
contain some formal background structure, needs to have a parameter such as time
that facilitates description of variations of the dynamical variables and, ﬁnally, needs
to contain some laws that pick out some variations of d from all possible variations.
In order to further ﬁx the dynamical variables d, we make use of the epistemic
asymmetry of conscious experience (Section 5.2).
The epistemic asymmetry states
that there are two fundamentally diﬀerent ways of gathering knowledge about con-
scious experience, the ﬁrst-person perspective and the third-person perspective. Thus
there are two epistemically diﬀerent notions of state in any experimental situation,
one that corresponds to ﬁrst-person access, and one that corresponds to third-person
access. While any metaphysical theory of consciousness can ignore one of these states,
a scientiﬁc model of consciousness cannot. The diﬀerence between a coherent idea and
a scientiﬁc model of consciousness is precisely that the latter addresses both types of
states, while the former need not.
Since the states that are accessible in the third-person perspective are in fact physical
states (neural states, brain states, or similar) and the states that are accessible in the
ﬁrst-person perspective are aspects of experience (with ‘aspect’ suitably deﬁned, cf.
above), this implies that the dynamical variables of a formal model of consciousness
are in fact a subset of
d = E × P ,
where E denotes the mathematical representation of conscious experience we have
introduced above and where P denotes the state space of some physical theory TP .
Combining the above gives a general framework in which models of consciousness
(Deﬁnition 5.3) can be formulated. It provides a reference to which models of con-
sciousness need to refer in light of consciousness’ epistemic context, independently


## Page 10

of how they are primarily deﬁned and independently of which ontological ideas they
express.
This general framework ﬁnally puts us into a position to investigate the implica-
tions of non-collatability in Section 6. First, in Section 6.1, we prove that in light of
non-collatability, models of consciousness are only well-deﬁned if they carry a partic-
ular symmetry. This is comparable to physical theories. Much like general relativity
carries a particular symmetry that ensures that the theory is well-deﬁned with re-
spect to changes of coordinates, our results show that models of consciousness need
to carry a particular symmetry that ensures that they are well-deﬁned with respect
to changes of labels. The changes of labels in question are precisely those transforma-
tion which keep the equivalence classes [e] introduced above constant, but transform
individual members of these equivalence classes. The corresponding symmetry group
is the automorphism group Aut(E) introduced above.
What is crucial in our results of Section 6.1 is that the symmetry required to exist is
not ﬁxed uniquely. There is a freedom in its form which depends on the laws of a model
of consciousness. This freedom describes how the transformations of labels relate to
transformations of physical states. Sections 6.2 and 6.3 are devoted to proving that
this remaining freedom is what allows formal models of consciousness to go beyond
what the standard methodology can do.
In a nutshell, this is so because the standard methodology can only utilize inter-
subjectively well-deﬁned references.
Mathematically, this means that the standard
methodology can only reference aspects of experience once it has imposed the group
Aut(E) in order to construct equivalence classes [e]. Formal models of consciousness,
on the other hand, allow one to reverse this order. They allow one to relate individual
elements of E and P prior to imposing the symmetry which ensures well-deﬁnedness.
Since all our arguments, proofs and derivations hold true also in the limiting cases
where all aspects of experience are either collatable or non-collatable, we summarize
all insights in a concise deﬁnition of what a model of consciousness is (Deﬁnition 6.4).
This is the main result of our project.
“Many scientiﬁc discoveries have been delayed over the
centuries for the lack of a mathematical language
that can amplify ideas and let scientists
communicate results.” [Pea09, p. 427]
3. Basic Definitions
In this section, we provide the basic deﬁnitions that underlie our constructions. In
Section 3.1, we specify the notion of experience we consider, introduce some funda-
mental terminology and give a deﬁnition of qualia in these terms. Subsequently, in
Section 3.2, we discuss the mathematical representation of experience. In Section 3.3,
we explain the implications of the deﬁning characteristic of qualia for any reference to
consciousness in an experiment or theory. As mentioned above, altogether this can be
taken to provide a grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, and Section 3.4
is devoted to summarize the resulting picture. In Section 3.5, ﬁnally, we give several
examples for the mathematical structure introduced in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
3.1. Conscious Experience and Qualia. The starting point of every scientiﬁc ac-
tivity related to consciousness is a preliminary choice of a class C of experiencing
subjects that are available for experimental investigations and which are targeted by

theoretical models. The object of investigation of any empirical study, and what in-
forms any model-building process, is experience of these experiencing subjects in the
following sense.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We use the term ‘conscious experience’ (‘experience’ for short) to
denote the totality of impressions, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, etc. which an expe-
riencing subject lives through at a particular instant of time.4
The general idea underlying any conception of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness is
to study experience and its relation to the physical domain by scientiﬁc means. Mostly,
some part or feature of experience is under consideration. In order to emphasise that
this part or feature may not be strictly separable from other parts of features, we use
the term ‘aspects of experience’:
Deﬁnition 3.2. Aspects of experience denote speciﬁc or general features, parts, prop-
erties or elements of a particular experience or of a set of experiences.
According to this deﬁnition, ‘aspect’ is thus merely a placeholder for ‘feature’, ‘part’,
‘property’ or ‘element of’. Which of these notions is relevant is part of the speciﬁcation
of a model of consciousness.
Example 3.3. Aspects of experience range from individual visual, auditory or tactile experi-
ences to general characteristics, such as the experience of a ﬁrst person perspective, the unity
of the conscious scene [Set07], or the structure and composition of experience [OAT14].
♦
A priori, every experiencing subject only has access to his/her own experience. How-
ever, systematic investigations of which aspects of experience are invariant over a large
class of experiencing subjects are possible and have been carried out as part of the
philosophical discipline of phenomenology.
Deﬁnition 3.4. A phenomenological axiom is a statement about aspects of experience
which holds for all experiencing subjects in a class C.5
Phenomenological axioms serve as a starting point for any investigation in the scien-
tiﬁc study of consciousness. In empirical studies, they are what can be correlated with
physical states, e.g. to construct neural correlates of consciousness. When building
models of consciousness, they are what informs the choice of mathematical structure.
In simple terms, phenomenological axioms are statements about how experiencing sub-
jects ﬁnd themselves experiencing, or how ‘the world’ appears to them. One could also
say that they express invariant facts of ‘what experience is like’ or of how experience
‘reveals itself’.
4No special focus on subjectivity is intended when using the term ‘experiencing subject’. Alterna-
tively, one could use the term ‘experiencer’. We also remark that the meaning of ‘instant’ is to be ﬁxed
during the model-building process. It could refer to physical just as well as to experiential instants of
time.
5The restriction to a class C of experiencing subjects is necessary because a phenomenological
analysis of invariants of experience is always restricted to experiencing subjects which are similar in
some respects: “[O]ne person can know or say of another what the quality of the other’s experience is.
[However, this] ascription of experience is possible only for someone suﬃciently similar to the object of
ascription to be able to adopt his point of view” [Nag74, p. 442]. However, the choice of class C is not
a constraint for models of consciousness, but rather a starting point, i.e. a preliminary choice which
informs the model-building process. Models may eventually allow one to determine which organisms
experience. We note also that the name ‘phenomenological axiom’ is a tribute to phenomenology
rather than an attempt to condense the phenomenological method into a simple deﬁnition.

Next, we make use of three basic phenomenological axioms in order to examine
in more detail which methodology may be used to study aspects of experience and
their relation to the physical domain. In preparation, we deﬁne the concept of non-
collatability.
Deﬁnition 3.5. An aspect of experience is non-collatable iﬀthere does not exist a
reasonable method to establish its identity over diﬀerent experiencing subjects in the
class C.6
Non-collatability of an aspect of experience can be determined operationally in any
experimental situation. Whenever there is no reasonable method to identify whether
two experiencing subjects in an experiment experience the same aspect of experience,
the aspect in question is non-collatable. However, the concept can also be applied in
a more fundamental context, as part of a phenomenological axiom about how subjects
experience the world. Several examples are given below.
Phenomenological Axiom 3.6. Aspects of experience can be divided into two
classes:
a) Aspects of experience which are non-collatable.
b) Aspects of experience which are collatable.
The former class includes aspects of experience which are experienced as ineﬀa-
ble [Lew29], private, or found to be cognitively, linguistically and communicatively
inaccessible [Met07]. But they also include those which are referred to as having a
subjective character [Nag74, p. 437] or connected to a particular point of view [Nag74,
p. 441]. Non-collatability is implied by, and hence a necessary condition of, all of these
characteristic features of experience. The latter class include those aspects which are
experienced as accessible also from other points of view [Nag74, p. 443] or as having
an objective nature [Nag74, p. 443].7
Example 3.7. Consider, as a ﬁrst example, experiences of awe. Subjects may report that
they have an experience of awe, and even give labels to various diﬀerent such experiences, but
there is, at present, no methodological procedure to establish whether any two experiences of
awe of two diﬀerent subjects are the same or not.
Some [Chu81, Den93] may hold that advanced neuroscientiﬁc theories may provide means
to collate the experiences of awe eventually. However, as we will see below, collatability is a
prerequisite of any theory that addresses speciﬁc aspects of conscious experience. If an aspect
of experience is non-collatable, no theory can be empirically inferred or tested that addresses
this aspect of experience.
♦
Example 3.8. Similarly, there is at present no possibility to meaningfully ask the question
of whether colour experiences of two experiencing subjects are the same or diﬀerent. This
simple but important fact is pointed at by the plain question of how two experiencing subjects
6 I.e., an aspect experienced by subject S1 is non-collatable iﬀthere is a diﬀerent experiencing
subject S2 such that there is no reasonable method to determine which aspect e′ of S2 the aspect e
of S1 is identical with. Put yet in diﬀerent terms, this is the case if there is no mapping from e to the
aspects of experiences of other experiencing subjects that can reasonably be interpreted as establishing
identity of aspects.
7When being presented with Phenomenological Axiom 3.6, scientists usually tend to think about
how this can be derived from a theory of language. In our opinion, the more important task is to
ground the underlying distinction in a thorough phenomenological analysis.
We also remark that
all formal constructions in this article are compatible with either of the classes in Phenomenological
Axiom 3.6 being empty, even though this is most likely not the case.

might come to conclude that the experience of colour which they have if they look at, e.g.,
the clear sky is the same. They may ensure that they use the same reference (‘blue’) for the
experience, that they see the same wavelength and they might even be able to conclude that
similar neuronal assemblies are active in both of their brains while having the experience in
question. However, none of this is a priori related to the color aspects of their experiences
(‘what it is like to see blue’).
Put diﬀerently, there is no reasonable way to assign truth values to statements of the
form ‘my colour experience e1 is equal to your colour experience e2’, equality is not a well-
deﬁned concept when referencing to experiences of two diﬀerent experiencing subjects. Thus
colour experiences are non-collatable aspects of experience in the sense of Phenomenological
Axiom 3.6.
This non-collatability has consequences for any scientiﬁc account of colour experience. E.g.,
any hypothesis that a particular neural activity occurs whenever a subject is experiencing a
colour ‘green’ is not well-deﬁned, simply because there is no intersubjectively meaningful ref-
erence to ‘green’; the colour experience one subject is having when when presented a 510nm
light source may be very diﬀerent from the colour experience another subject is having when
presented the same light source. In other words, any intersubjective reference to colour ex-
periences carries a certain ambiguity, which has to be taken into account when constructing
models or designing experiments related to colour experience.
♦
The main point of this paper, argued for in detail below, is that non-collatable as-
pects of experience cannot be addressed by the usual scientiﬁc methodology. Since the
term ‘qualia’ is generally used to denote what is considered as essential in a particular
analysis of experience, we introduce the following abbreviation.
Deﬁnition 3.9. We deﬁne the term qualia to refer to all non-collatable aspects of
experience of an experiencing subject within the class C.
Example 3.10. According to Example 3.8, colour experiences satisfy the condition of Deﬁni-
tion 3.9. Thus colour experiences are qualia.8
♦
Example 3.11. Example 3.10 is a special case of the aspects of experience referenced by
Thomas Nagel in [Nag74] when introducing his famous notion of ‘What is it like to be ... ?’:
“[F]undamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there
is something that it is like to be that organism – something it is like for that
organism. We may call this the subjective character of experience.” (p. 436)
Nagel also uses the term “how it is for the subject himself” (p. 440) to point to these aspects
of experience. Though [Nag74] does not make the distinction of Phenomenological Axiom 3.6
central to his line of reasoning, one can ﬁnd hints toward this distinction in [Nag74]: E.g., he
claims that “we do not possess the vocabulary to describe [what it is like to be us] adequately” (p.
440), there are “facts that do not consist in the truth of propositions expressible in a human
language.” (p. 441)
♦
3.2. Formal Representation of Experience. In order to deﬁne a formal represen-
tation of experience, we make use of two further basic phenomenological axioms. These
are very general in nature and it is plausible that they hold independently of the par-
ticular choice of class C. However, due to the restricted possibility of phenomenological
analysis mentioned above, we generally assume C to comprise adult humans. The ﬁrst
phenomenological axiom expresses the observation that some qualia are experienced as
identical, whereas others are not, or in other words, that one sometimes experiences
a non-collatable aspect as identical to a non-collatable aspect one has experienced at
another time.
8We generally abbreviate ‘colour aspects of experience’ by ‘colour experience’.

Phenomenological Axiom 3.12. Qualia can be recognised to a certain extent: Ex-
periencing subjects can identify qualia which they have previously experienced.
Example 3.13. Phenomenological Axiom 3.12 states that experiencing subjects may perceive
some aspects they experience at diﬀerent times to be identical. For example, it could be the
case that someone ﬁnds the taste aspect experienced when trying artiﬁcial strawberry ﬂavour to
be identical to the taste aspect experienced when eating an actual strawberry. This recognition
of previously experienced aspects is simply a “subjective impression” of identity, so to speak.
♦
Phenomenal Fact 3.12 is important because it is the basis of the ability of an ex-
periencing subject to introduce labels for his/her qualia, i.e. a name or reference for
non-collatable aspects of his/her experience. Recognisability is presupposed in the no-
tion of collatability, so that labels of collatable aspects of experience can be introduced
by deﬁnition.
In what follows, we assume that labels are chosen such that diﬀerent aspects of ex-
perience are associated with diﬀerent labels and, using Phenomenological Axiom 3.12,
that the same label is used to denote various occurrences of the same aspect.9 Fur-
thermore, we assume that all experiencing subjects use the same set of labels, which
we denote by E. For our purposes, E can be any set, which labels the set consists of
does not matter in what follows.
The second phenomenological axiom expresses the observation that something can
be said about how non-collatable aspects occur in, or constitute, experience. In [Nag74],
it corresponds to the observation that “structural features of perception might be more
accessible to objective description, even though something would be left out” [Nag74,
p. 449]. In [Cha96], it corresponds to the observation that “even if experiences are
in some sense ‘ineﬀable,’ relations between experiences are not; we have no trouble
discussing these relations, whether they be relations of similarity and diﬀerence, geo-
metric relations, relations of intensity, and so on. As Schlick [Sch38] pointed out, the
form of experience seems to be straightforwardly communicable, even if the content
(intrinsic quality) is not” [Cha96, p. 224].
Phenomenological Axiom 3.14. Qualia have relations that can be collated within
the class C.
By Deﬁnition 3.4, this is a claim about experiences of all experiencing subjects in
the class C. In simple terms, it expresses the fact that something can be said about
non-collatable aspects of experience, something about how they appear in experience.
The collatability of the relations implies that we may represent the relations on the
set of labels E and assume (i.e. ask, cf. Footnote 9) labels to be chosen in such a way
that the experienced relations between qualia are reﬂected in the relations represented
on the labels. We assume that Phenomenological Axiom 3.14 also holds for collatable
aspects of experience, so that they have relations, too, that can be represented on the
set of labels.10
9Note that throughout this section, assumptions are in fact conventions. E.g., this assumption can
be satisﬁed by asking experiencing subjects (in an experiment, say) to choose labels as described. The
assumptions can be made ‘without loss of generality’, so to speak.
10Phenomenological Axiom 3.14 states that there are relations between qualia which are collatable.
This expresses the observations in [Nag74], [Cha96] and [Sch38] that structural features of perception,
relations between experiences or the form of experience might be more accessible to communication or
objective description. However, one might question whether this axiom is warranted, and insist that

Example 3.15. For qualia of the ‘what it is like to be’ type (introduced in Example 3.11)
these relations include
◮Similarity: Two qualia can be more or less similar.
◮Intensity: A quale can occur in more or less intense versions.
among others.11
♦
Example 3.16. Experiencing subjects typically experience some pairs of colours as similar to
each other, whereas they experience others as not similar. E.g., small changes in hue usually
result in colours which are perceived as similar, whereas large changes in hue result in colours
which are not experienced as similar.
What is crucial for our purposes is that one may (and in practise often does) represent the
experience of similarity of colours on the set of colour labels. Correspondingly, one may (and
in practise often does) ask experiencing subjects to choose labels for their colour experiences
in such a way that colours which are experienced as similar are similar according to the
representation on colour space.12 We will study this in detail in Example 3.20 below.
♦
Phenomenological Axiom 3.12 provides the possibility to introduce labels for non-
collatable and collatable aspects of experience. What Phenomenological Axiom 3.14
adds to this is the possibility to represent relations between aspects of experience on the
set of labels. Since any representation of a relation on a set is mathematical in nature,
so are these representations. They give either relations on E in the mathematical sense
of the word (i.e. a subset R of E × E) or some more involved mathematical structure,
which turns E into a mathematical space.13
Thus, together, these two phenomenological axioms ground a representation of ex-
perience in terms of mathematical structure. We refer to the set of labels E together
with its mathematical structure that represents relations between qualia as
Experience space E,
(3.1)
though it is important to keep in mind that this space does not describe experience
per se, but only labels and the structural relations between aspects of experiences they
represent. This space E is the mathematical representation of experience mentioned
above. Every element e ∈E refers either to a collatable aspect of experience or to a
quale. Several detailed examples are given in Section 3.5 below.
relations between experiences are not (strictly, at least) collatable. (Thanks to an anonymous referee
for pointing this out.) The formalism developed here requires the collatability of relations, so that any
non-collatable relation has to be ignored.
11Similarity and intensity are simple examples of collatable relations between qualia. There may
be many more collatable relations which express facts about how qualia appear in experience, some of
which may only relate qualia of a particular type to each other. Further examples arguably include:
Composition: Some qualia are experienced as a composition of two (or more) diﬀerent qualia. I.e., the
composed quale is but a combination (or simultaneous experience) of the composing qualia. Inclusion:
Some qualia may be experienced as containing one (or more) other qualia. Here, the contained quale
is but an aspect of the containing quale. Also, the distinction between various types (visual, auditory,
tactile, etc.) of non-collatable aspects of experience is a relation in the sense of Phenomenological
Axiom 3.14.
12Note that this example is complicated by the fact that we calibrate colour experiences in practise:
We apply or learn rules on how to pick colour labels related to external events such as wave-length
impinging on the eye. This will be discussed in detail in Example 3.20 below. What is crucial is that a
priori, individual labels so chosen do not correlate with colour experience: Two experiencing subjects
may have a completely diﬀerent colour experience despite using the same label ‘blue’.
13Here, the term ‘mathematical space’ is used to refer to a set which carries additional mathematical
structure.
Examples are metric spaces, topological spaces, vector spaces, diﬀerentiable manifolds,
principal bundles, measurable spaces and Hilbert spaces.

In order for the mathematics to come out right in what follows, we have to in-
troduce an important mathematical convention with respect to collatable aspects of
experience. By Deﬁnition 3.5, an aspect of experience is collatable if its identity over
all experiencing subjects in the class C can be established. This implies, in particular,
that this aspect of experience can be referenced: In virtue of its collatability, it can
be assigned a unique label used by all experiencing subjects in C. Our convention, in
what follows, is that this is represented in the mathematical structure of E.
Convention 3.17. We assume that for every collatable aspect of experience, the
mathematical structure of E contains a unary collatable relation χ which allows one
to select this aspect of experience uniquely.14
In practise, this means that for any e ∈E which is collatable, there is a subset χe ⊂E
which contains only e. This convention ensures that changes of labels, discussed next,
can be represented conveniently using the automorphism group. It ensures that all
the collatable information is represented in the relations between aspects, so that all
aspects can be treated alike in the technical deﬁnitions that follow.
In summary, so far we have constructed a space E whose elements denote aspects
of experience (both collatable and non-collatable ones), e.g. phenomenal properties
or elements of experience. Furthermore, this space carries relations or more advanced
mathematical structures that expresses the structural features of experience, as well
as information about which aspects of experience are collatable (in virtue of Con-
vention 3.17).
This allows us to give a concise account of references to aspects of
experience that takes non-collatability into account, as we explain next.
3.3. References to Qualia. In virtue of non-collatability, any reference to qualia is
ambiguous. In this section, we explain in detail why and in doing so, develop formal
tools that allow us to quantify this ambiguity precisely.
We proceed in two steps. First, we discuss the case where an experiencing subject
uses labels to report on his/her experience without taking into account any of the
collatable relations. This is a preparatory step whose purpose is to explain the following
constructions in detail. Since it ignores the relations on E, i.e. structural features of
experience, it is artiﬁcial and will give a pathological result.
Subsequently, in the
second step, we discuss the appropriate case which takes the mathematical structure
of E into account.
Preparation: References that ignore relations.
Let us assume that an experiencing
subject uses labels to report on his/her experience without taking into account any of
the collatable relations. In this case the experiencing subject is free to choose any label
to denote any aspect of experience, the only requirements being that diﬀerent labels are
used for diﬀerent aspects and that the same label is being used for a recurrent aspect.
We call a choice of labels of an experiencing subject to denote his/her experienced
aspects a labelling and use the term relabelling to denote a change of labelling. In the
present case, a relabelling is simply a map
s : E →E,
e 7→s(e) ,
(3.2)
which determines which label s(e) replaces the previous label e. Since diﬀerent aspects
are required to carry diﬀerent labels, this map is injective. Since it furthermore has
domain and codomain E, it is bijective. Since any composition of two relabellings of the
14A unary relation on E is simply a subset of E.


## Page 17

17
form (3.2) yields another relabelling, and since due to the bijectivity, each map (3.2)
is invertible, all possible relabellings form a group: The group of all bijective maps
from E to itself. This group is called the symmetric group of the set E.
The crucial insight here is that the group of relabellings allows us to quantify the
ambiguity of any statement that refers to aspects of experience. Consider e.g. the
case where a statement only involves one label e1 ∈E. Since we are disregarding
collatable relations at this point, this statement could just as well have been formulated
with any other label e2 ∈E, simply because an experiencing subject may choose any
label whatsoever to denote any quale. Mathematically, this is reﬂected by the fact
that there is at least one relabelling s such that s(e1) = e2.
The same reasoning
can be applied to sequences (e1, ... , en) of labels, e.g. obtained by verbal reports at
subsequent times. The ambiguity of a sequence (e1, ... , en) of labels is the set of all
sequences (e′
1, ... , e′
n) which can be obtained from the former by a relabelling s, i.e.
the set of all sequences (e′
1, ... , e′
n) for which there exists a relabelling s such that
(e′
1, ... , e′
n) = (s(e1), ... , s(en)).
These statements are in fact statements about equivalence classes.
To see this,
deﬁne two labels e1 and e2 to be equivalent, e1
.∼e2, if and only if there exists a
relabelling s such that s(e1) = e2. The ambiguity of a label e ∈E is given precisely
by the equivalence class of this label,
[e] :=

e′ | e′
.∼e
	
=

e′ | ∃s : e′ = s(e)
	
,
(3.3)
because this class contains all labels which an experiencing subject could have cho-
sen.
The same is true for sequences: If we deﬁne two sequences to be equivalent,
(e′
1, ... , e′
n) .∼(e1, ... , en), if and only if there exists a relabelling s such that (e′
1, ... , e′
n) =
(s(e1), ... , s(en)), the ambiguity of a sequence of labels is given precisely by the equiv-
alence class of this sequence,
[(e1, ... , en)] :=

(e′
1, ... , e′
n) | (e′
1, ... , e′
n) .∼(e1, ... , en)
	
,
(3.4)
because this class contains precisely all those descriptions of the sequence which an
experiencing subject may give.
Another way to put this is that the equivalence
classes (3.3) and (3.4) are what is empirically well-deﬁned, not the labels themselves,
these only have meaning for the experiencing subject him/herself once he/she has
chosen a particular labelling.
This concludes the description of the case that ignores structural features of experi-
ence. Its artiﬁcial nature is reﬂected in the fact that the symmetric group allows one
to map any choice (e1, ... , en) of labels to any other choice (e′
1, ... , e′
n), provided that
every label occurs at most once in each choice. Thus there are very few equivalence
classes (only one if n = 1). We now proceed to the discussion of the appropriate case.
Taking Relations into Account. Next, we take into account the collatable relations
between aspects of experience as established in Phenomenological Axiom 3.14.
To
do so, we work with the experience space E introduced above: I.e., we assume that
the relations between qualia have been represented on the set of labels15 and ask
experiencing subjects to pick labels for the qualia they experience in accordance with
this representation. As above, we refer to any such choice as labelling.
15For all practical purposes, one can obtain such a representation by simply asking one experiencing
subject to pick a labelling and to report, in terms of this labelling, on his/her experienced relations.
Other experiencing subjects are then required to choose labels according to this representation. For
details, see Example 3.20 below. For explicit examples on how such a representation might look, cf.
Examples 3.21 to 3.24 below.


## Page 18

J. KLEINER
This constraint on how labels can be chosen implies that the freedom of every
experiencing subject to choose labels is smaller than in the case above: Functions (3.2)
only constitute relabellings if they preserve the collatable relations represented on the
set E, i.e. if they preserve the structure of the space E. A bijective function from a
space to itself which preserves the structure of this space is called an automorphism of
the space. As above, automorphisms form a group. Thus in the case where we take
into account the collatable relations, relabellings are elements of the
Automorphism group Aut(E).
(3.5)
We summarize this by saying that the automorphism group Aut(E) describes the
freedom of relabelling of every experiencing subject.
It is here that Convention 3.17 is important. Since for every collatable aspect of
experience there is a unary relation which the automorphism group needs to leave
invariant, this convention ensures that automorphisms do not change labels of collat-
able aspects of experience. As a result, the automorphism group allows us to quantify
precisely the ambiguity inherent any reference to qualia.
In order to identify the ambiguity of any statement that uses a sequence (e1, ... , en)
of labels, we can argue exactly as in the simpliﬁed description above, replacing trans-
formations (3.2) by automorphisms. The result is that the ambiguity is given precisely
by the equivalence class
[(e1, ... , en)] :=

(e′
1, ... , e′
n) | (e′
1, ... , e′
n) ∼(e1, ... , en)
	
,
(3.6)
where ∼denotes the equivalence relation deﬁned as
(e′
1, ... , e′
n) ∼(e1, ... , en)
if and only if there is an s ∈Aut(E)
such that e′
i = s(ei) for all i = 1, ... , n .
(3.7)
This class contains precisely all descriptions of the sequence of aspects of experiences
which an experiencing subject might give: A description in every possible labelling.
To obtain the ambiguity of individual labels, we simply set n = 1.
In summary, what this shows is that the empirically well-deﬁned references to ex-
perience are given by elements of the quotient space
E×n/∼,
(3.8)
where E is the space (3.1) whose structure represents collatable relations between
aspects of experience, where ∼denotes the equivalence relation (3.7) and where n ∈N
is the length of a sequence.
Remark 3.18. In practise, we typically establish labels by reference to particular
“external” events, such as particular wavelengths emerging from a light source in the
case of colour experiences. Socially established labels of this sort are of course very
useful in various circumstances, precisely because they correlate with external events.
However, a priori there is no reason to assume that qualia of diﬀerent experiencing
subjects which are denoted by the same label are the same, even if the labels correlate
with the same external event.16 In fact, an assumption of this kind has no empirical
meaning because the deﬁnition of qualia implies that neither the identity of qualia of
diﬀerent experiencing subjects with an external event, nor the equality of qualia of
diﬀerent experiencing subjects can be empirically tested. Statements of this sort can
16One may even take this to be unlikely, given the diﬀerence of brain physiology and neuronal
structure across individuals.

only be meaningful if formulated based on a scientiﬁc methodology which is compatible
with the non-collatability of the aspects of experience under consideration.
♦
3.4. A Phenomenological Grounding of the Scientiﬁc Study of Conscious-
ness. In the previous sections, we have ﬁxed basic terminology, such as what we take
the term experience to denote and how qualia are deﬁned in these terms. We have fur-
thermore used phenomenological axioms to warrant introduction of labels, which has
in turn allowed us to ground a mathematical representation of experience. Finally, we
have analysed the implications of non-collatability (and hence of ineﬀability, private-
ness and inaccessibility) in terms of this formal representation. Together, this gives
rise to a grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, i.e. allows us to specify
what is to be studied and how.
First, concerning the task of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, what is to be stud-
ied is simply experience as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.1 and its relation to the physical
domain. By Phenomenological Axiom 3.6, this includes collatable aspects of expe-
rience as well as qualia.
What is required to do so is a combination of the usual
scientiﬁc methodology with some novel tools (developed in the remainder of this arti-
cle). How these methodologies are combined is described by the formal representation
of conscious experience in the experience space E.
The usual scientiﬁc methodology, e.g. the one in use today in the neuroscience of
consciousness, can be applied to all intersubjectively well-deﬁned references to expe-
rience, i.e. to the equivalence classes (3.6). When taken together, they constitute the
quotient space (3.8), which provides a comprehensive description of all intersubjec-
tively meaningful aspects of experience. This quotient space contains, in particular,
all references to collatable aspects of experience.
However, the usual scientiﬁc methodology cannot be used to investigate individual
elements of equivalence classes (3.6), if a class has more than one element, because
the experiences labelled by these elements cannot be referenced intersubjectively in a
meaningful way. These elements in fact generate an explanatory gap (Section 4). The
study of these aspects of experience is, nevertheless, part of the task of the scientiﬁc
study of consciousness. There is a fact as to which member of an equivalence class is
experienced, and this fact cannot a priori be excluded from constituting a scientiﬁc
explanandum.
The main achievement of this article in the following sections is to show that formal
tools can be deﬁned that allow us to go beyond a scientiﬁc analysis of the quotient
space (3.8). Referring to these results, we can specify the grounding that arises from
the previous deﬁnitions as follows. Due to the importance of phenomenological axioms
in grounding the formal structure, we refer to this grounding as phenomenological
grounding.
Deﬁnition 3.19. What is to be studied by the scientiﬁc study of consciousness ac-
cording to the phenomenological grounding is experience as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.1
and its relation to the physical domain. This includes the study of intersubjectively
well-deﬁned aspects of experience using the quotient space (3.8) and standard scien-
tiﬁc methodology, as well as the study of qualia proper, represented formally in the
experience space (3.1) using the formal-mathematical methodology derived in Section 6.
3.5. Examples. We close this section with several examples. First, in Example 3.20,
we continue the discussion of colour experience and show that colour spaces, which
are largely in use in commercial applications, constitute the experience spaces for

colour qualia as deﬁned above. In Example 3.21 to 3.24 we consider various possible
mathematical structures of the experience space E, some of which have been proposed
in the literature.
Example 3.20. To illustrate the meaning of the experience space E and the group Aut(E),
as well as Remark 3.18, we consider again colour experiences. As we have explained in Exam-
ple 3.8, these satisfy the deﬁning property of qualia.
We will generally denote the quale ‘what it is like to see light of wavelength λ’ as ‘experience
of λ’. For the purpose of this example, we will disregard of the fact that colour experience
is highly sensitive to the geometry of the lighting of a scene and to the expected material
properties of an object’s surface. We will use the symbol ¯λ to denote a mixture of light of
varying wavelength.
We start by ﬁxing a particular human oberver, the “standard observer” [Kue10], and choose
a set Ecl that is in one-to-one correspondence to all colours which this human can experience.
As usual in colour science, we assume that there is a large class C of humans which have the
same set of possible colour experiences as the standard observer. This assumption implies that
every human in the class C can specify a one-to-one mapping between the set Ecl and his/her
colour experiences. The fact that color experiences are qualia as deﬁned here is reﬂected in the
fact that there is no unique one-to-one mapping. The set Ecl is thus a set of labels of colour
qualia as introduced after Phenomenological Axiom 3.12. It is also the basis of the deﬁnition
of colour spaces (cf. below).
The set Ecl can be calibrated: Since colour experiences arguably arise as a response to
mixtures ¯λ of light impending on the retina, we may identify every element e ∈Ecl with a
particular mixture ¯λ. The set of mixtures visible to the human eye can, in turn, be represented17
as a subset S ⊂R3, roughly speaking by taking the three components of a vector v ∈S
to represent the relative intensities of three reference wavelengths. Putting these two steps
together, we may in fact choose the set Ecl to be the subset S ⊂R3. In this case, every label
e ∈Ecl is a 3-tuple of real numbers which speciﬁes which mixture ¯λ of light has to be presented
to a particular human to evoke the quale that he/she has denoted by that very label e.
This calibration may lead one to think that there is a unique way of referring to colour
qualia.
However, this is not the case.
To see this, assume that we ﬁx some label/vector
e ∈S = Ecl as well as two experiencing subjects A and B. Let us denote the mixture of light
that corresponds to this vector as ¯λv. When we present this mixture ¯λv to the two experiencing
subjects, subject A has the colour experience he/she has labelled as e, and so does subject B.
However, this has nothing to say on whether the colour experiences are the same or not:
E.g., subject B might have the colour experience subject A is having upon presentation of a
completely diﬀerent mixture ¯λw ̸= ¯λv.
This illustrates the fundamental diﬃculty related to qualia as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.9: If we
would “know” (e.g. as the result of some scientiﬁc investigation) that the presentation of the
same colour stimuli ¯λv to various subjects results in them having the same colour experience,
we could meaningfully talk, or refer to, colour experiences of diﬀerent subjects in terms of
stimuli. More generally, if statements of the type
“subject A will have colour experience X1 once presented input ¯λ”
(3.9)
would be known, these statements would allow us to directly refer to A’s colour experiences,
putting us into the position to do science as usual. However, the fundamental diﬃculty of the
17This is an experimental fact which is due to biological details of the cone cells in the human
eye. Since various mixtures ¯λ evoke the same colour experience, some conventions have to be made in
order to ﬁx the subset S uniquely (e.g. a choice of reference wavelengths). Also, due to the particular
responsivity curves of the cone cells, no ﬁnite set of wave-lengths can be combined to achieve all
colours that a human can experience. However, suitable experimental procedures exist so that all
visible mixtures can be represented in R3 nevertheless [Kue10].

subject is that statements like (3.9) do not carry any intersubjective meaning at all: Due to
the impossibility of collating colour experiences, statement (3.9) cannot be distinguished (by
anyone but subject A) from the statement
“subject A will have colour experience X2 once presented input ¯λ”,
where X2 is any colour experience of A with the same unary collatable relations (such as
intensity). This problem exists independently of whether we consider the statement (3.9) to
be a hypothesis or to be the result of some purported scientiﬁc investigation. Statements of
this type do not have unambiguous intersubjective meaning.
As explained above, what has intersubjective meaning are the equivalence classes (3.6).
They express facts about colour experience which are invariant with respect to the labelling
that an experiencing subject chooses. We now illustrate this in detail for colour qualia.
First, we need to ﬁnd the collatable relations between colour experiences referred to in
Phenomenological Axiom 3.14.
Luckily, this has been on the agenda of colour science for
decades, so that we may simply turn to its results. Put in simple terms, there seem to be
three types of collatable relations [Kue10]: Continuity of change of colours (whether some
time-continuous sequence of colour experiences is perceived as continuous or not), behaviour
under mixtures of colours (whether a mixture of two colour experiences is perceived as equal
to another colour experience or not) and (less well known) a notion of distance of colours
(whether two colour experiences are perceived as more diﬀerent to each other than another
pair of colour experiences).
Next, we need to translate these collatable relations into mathematical structures on the
set Ecl. This yields the experience space (3.1) of colour qualia. Again, colour scientists have
done the work for us: They have deﬁned colour spaces in order to formalize these collatable
relations [Kue10]. A colour space is a closed subset S of R3 which is in a one-to-one corre-
spondence with all colours humans may experience, chosen such that continuity is represented
by the induced topology of R3 (a path of colours experiences is continuous if the labels form
a continuous path in the colour space), mixture is represented by straight lines (equal mixing
of two colour experiences e1 and e2 yields the colour experience that carries the label that is
at the center of the straight line that connects e1 and e2), and ﬁnally experienced distance of
colour qualia is represented by a metric on S. 18 Thus a colour space is a experience space (3.1)
for colour qualia.
There are many subsets of R3 which satisfy these requirements: For any choice of subset S,
there is a large class of transformation of R3 which, together with a corresponding transforma-
tion of the metric, yield another subset S′ of R3 which equally represents colour experiences
as well as their collatable relation. Colour science uses the calibration described above to ﬁx
speciﬁc choices of subsets S, so that the coordinates of the elements of S can be translated into
mixtures of wavelengths ¯λ. However, as explained above, for the study of colour experience,
calibrations do not have any relevance a priori, so that no particular choice of subset can be
singled out.
In order to specify the group of relabellings for this example, we note that in more abstract
terms, a colour space is19 a smooth 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold: Its topology repre-
sents the continuous changes of colour experience and its metric g speciﬁes both the geodesics
(generalized “straight lines”), which describe the mixture of colour experiences, as well as a
distance function which describes the experience of distance between colour qualia. The vari-
ous choices of subsets S of R3 correspond precisely to choices of coordinates of this manifold.
18We take it that straight lines describe mixtures of colour experiences, which have to be distin-
guished from the experience of mixtures of colours. Thanks to an anonymous referee for pointing this
out.
19Cf. [Kue10]. However, note that a more axiomatic treatment may result in diﬀerent mathematical
spaces [Res74, Pro17]. Furthermore, the assumption of smoothness may not be justiﬁed and one might
have to consider manifolds with corners.

We summarize this as
E = (Ecl, g) .
(3.10)
This is the actual form of the experience space (3.1) of colour qualia. Its elements label the set
of colour experiences and its structure represents the collatable relations between them. An
experiencing subject can specify his/her colour experiences by specifying points (in the case of
individual colour experiences) or curves (in the case of time-continuous colour experiences) on
this manifold. The freedom of choosing labels is described by the automorphism group of E. In
the case (3.10) of a Riemannian manifold, this is the group of isometries, i.e. diﬀeomorphisms
which leave the metric invariant:
Aut(E) = Iso(E) .
Thus the ambiguity of any statement in terms of colour labels (e1, ... , en) is given by the
equivalence class
[(e1, ... , en)]
which is deﬁned as in (3.6) with two sequences being equivalent if there is an isometry s ∈
Iso(E) which transforms every element of the ﬁrst sequence into the corresponding element
of the second sequence.20 The actual form of the equivalence classes depends on the metric
g, which can be determined experimentally.
The current version of the distance function
internationally in use is reviewed e.g. in [SWD04], a discussion of which however goes beyond
the scope of this example.21
Putting everything together, we conclude that any statement, scientiﬁc or otherwise, that
addresses colour experiences sensu stricto – i.e. which addresses what it is like to experience
colours – only makes sense if it is invariant with respect to Iso(E) transformations. This is
a consequence of the fact that qualia are non-collatable and of the corresponding freedom of
every experiencing subject to choose names for the qualia he/she experiences.
The diﬀerence between labels of colour experiences and colour experiences (colour experi-
ences de dicto and colour experiences de re, so to speak), can be crucial for scientiﬁc investi-
gations. For example, if a study compares the calibrated label e that a subject reports with
neural activity, it does not investigate the relation between neural activity and colour experi-
ence but rather the relation between neural activity and presentation of wavelengths ¯λ to the
retina. These two objects of investigation refer to completely diﬀerent scientiﬁc agendas.
♦
Example 3.21. Pretopological structure on E. In the previous example, we have relied
on results from colour science to provide the mathematical structure of the experience space
E that represents the colour aspects of experience. The goal of this example is to illustrate in
more detail how the mathematical structure of E can be deﬁned directly in terms of relations
between qualia. To this end, we consider the relation of similarity of two qualia explained
in Example 3.15, but understood in a binary way. I.e., for the purpose of this example, we
make the simplifying assumption that any two non-collatable aspects of experience (of one
experiencing subject) are experienced either as ‘similar’ or as ‘not similar’, and ignore the
experience of varying degrees of similarity. While this restriction may not be warranted in
practise, we take it to be justiﬁed for pedagogical purposes. When understood in this way, the
20Since the ordering of distances between pairs of colours, rather than the numerical value of the
distance itself, is collatable, one could make the point that the relabelling freedom is given by the
group of diﬀeomorphisms which leave the metric invariant up to a conformal factor. Since the present
example is, mainly, of a pedagogical interest, we do not explore this further at this point. Cf. also
Footnote 19.
21We note that it is possible that some sequences (e1, ... , en) are not ambiguous, i.e.
that
[(e1, ... , en)] = {(e1, ... , en)}.
This means that there is one unique sequence of colour experiences
which has the properties represented by the sequence (e1, ... , en) of labels, or put diﬀerently, that
there is only one possible choice of labels for this sequence that takes into account the collatable re-
lations as described. Sequences of this kind may be used to remove the ambiguity of the labels they
contain and make these aspects of experience accessible to a proper scientiﬁc analysis.

similarity relation can be used to deﬁne a pretopological structure on E as described in [Pre19]
(with a slightly diﬀerent goal in mind), whose presentation we now follow.22
First, we deﬁne a binary relation R◦⊂E × E on E. If two qualia with labels e1 and e2 are
perceived as similar by an experiencing subject, we deﬁne the corresponding labels to be related
according to R◦, which we denote as e1 ◦e2 (i.e. e1 ◦e2 ⇔(e1, e2) ∈R◦, and similarly below).
Thus R◦is given directly by experience. We assume that e ◦e for all e ∈E. Second, based on
the data of R◦, we deﬁne another relation R≤on E, called “parthood relation” [Pre19] as
e1 ≤e2
iﬀ
e ◦e1 ⇒e ◦e2 .
Thus e1 ≤e2 holds iﬀall qualia which are similar to e1 are also similar to e2. Third, we use
the parthood relation R≤to deﬁne yet another relation R∼, called “connection”, as follows:
e1 ∼e2
iﬀ
∃˜e ∈E such that ˜e ◦e1 and ˜e ◦e2
as well as e ≤˜e ⇒e ◦e1 or e ◦e2 .
Note that e1 ≤e2 implies e1 ∼e2. We extend this notation to sets A ⊂E by deﬁning
e ∼A iﬀe ∼˜e for at least one ˜e ∈A.
This allows us to deﬁne an operator pcl, which takes a subset A ⊂E to another subset pcl(A)
which contains all qualia which are connected to at least one of the qualia in A:
pcl(A) := {e | e ∼A} .
The operator pcl satisﬁes three of the four Kuratowski closure axioms [Per64, Sec. 3.2], but
need not satisfy pcl(pcl(A)) = pcl(A) for all A ⊂E (idempotence). Hence it constitutes a
preclosure operator, so that (E, pcl) constitute a pretopological space [nLa19].
In order to deﬁne what constitutes a relabelling in this example, we note that a function f
between two pretopological spaces (E, pcl) and (E′, pcl′) is deﬁned to be continuous if
f(pcl(A)) ⊆pcl′(f(A))
for all A ⊂E. The automorphism group Aut(E) of (E, pcl) is the set of all continuous invertible
functions f : E →E whose inverse is also continuous, with group operation given by function
composition.
Thus we see neatly how non-trivial mathematical properties of the experience space E can
be deﬁned directly in terms of experienced relations between qualia. The similarity relation
established via Phenomenological Axiom 3.14 may, of course, not actually be binary: There
seem to be various degrees, maybe even a continuum, of similarities of qualia.
♦
Example 3.22. Partial order on E. Our next example goes back to [Res18]. First, we
observe that next to the two relations mentioned in Phenomenological Axiom 3.14, qualia may
in fact have compositional relations that can be collated: An experiencing subject may ﬁnd
that the ineﬀable aspect of an experience he/she is having at a particular time includes an
ineﬀable aspect he/she has had at another time. In this case, we may say that the former
quale includes the latter quale. If e1 is the label which the experiencing subject has chosen for
the former quale and e2 is the label he/she has chosen for the latter quale, we will denote this
relation between the two qualia as e2 ≤e1.
By convention, we may put e ≤e for all e ∈E (reﬂexivity). Furthermore, it is reasonable
to hold that if both e1 ≤e2 and e2 ≤e1 for two labels e1, e2 ∈E, these labels actually
refer to the same quale, so that e1 = e2 (anti-symmetry). Finally, qualia seem to satisfy that
e1 ≤e2 and e2 ≤e3 imply e1 ≤e3 (transitivity). Therefore, this actually constitutes a partial
order on E and turns (E, ≤) into a partially ordered set. The automorphism group consists
22The following deﬁnitions and their relation to topology are intuitively accessible if one thinks
about open balls in a metric space such as R3, where ◦is deﬁned as overlap. We remark, however,
that the construction does not give rise to a topology, as claimed in [Pre19], since the third Kuratowski
closure axiom (idempotence) does not follow.

of bijective functions f : E →E which are order-embedding, i.e. which satisfy e1 ≤e2 if and
only if f(e1) ≤f(e2) for all e1, e2 ∈E. Thus one can see nicely that the automorphism group
describes the freedom of relabelling: Its elements represent changes of labels which preserve
the inclusion relation between qualia.
♦
Example 3.23. Involutive semigroup structure on E.
This example also goes back
to [Res18]. In order to state it, note that in Deﬁnition 3.1, we have deﬁned the term ‘experience’
with respect to instants of time. This implies that qualia (being aspects of experience) are
associated to a instant of time as well,23 therefore excluding a sequence of two qualia arising
at two consecutive instants of time to constitute another quale. However, one might drop this
restriction to instants of time, and deﬁne qualia as aspects of experience in general. Following
this line of thought, one could argue that for any two qualia e1, e2, there is another quale e3
which is the consecutive experience of the two qualia. One might denote e3 as
e3 = e1 & e2 ,
where the ‘&’ represents “and then” [Res18]. If one furthermore demands associativity, which
does seem to be plausible, this deﬁnes a semigroup (E, &).
Next, one may consider an operation which reverses this temporal order of qualia. This
may or may not have deep conceptual meaning: On the one hand, it may merely map any
quale of the form e1 & e2 to a quale of the form e2 & e1, both of which have to exist due to the
semigroup structure introduced above. On the other hand, it may express a deep fact about
reversal of psychological time [Res18]. In both cases, skipping over a few technical details, this
gives rise to an involution [Res18], i.e. a map
∗: E →E
such that
e 7→e∗
(e∗)∗= e .
In summary, the time composition relation of qualia may be represented on the space of labels
in terms of an involutive semigroup structure.
♦
Example 3.24. Hilbert space structure on E. The last example is intended to evaluate
in how far the axioms of a Hilbert space can be grounded in the relations introduced in
Phenomenal Fact 3.14.
The upshot is that whereas some of the axioms can be motivated
based on Phenomenological Axiom 3.14, others cannot. Nevertheless, the example may prove
valuable for constructing toy models of consciousness, which is why we include it here.
In what follows, we make several assumptions about the set of all experiences which an
experiencing subject might have.
These assumptions are phenomenological in ﬂavour, yet
some may ultimately not be justiﬁed.
(A1) We assume that with respect to any two qualia of one experiencing subject, the expe-
riencing subject might have an experience which has exactly these qualia as ineﬀable
aspects.
With respect to qualia of the ‘what it is like to be’ type (Example 3.11), this assumption
amounts to the following statement: If an experiencing subject has made an experience which
included an ineﬀable ‘what is it like to be’ aspect (quale) which he/she labels by e1, and
another experience which included an ineﬀable ‘what is it like to be’ aspect (quale) which
he/she labels by e2, then it is possible that he/she will make an experience which has exactly
e1 and e2 as ineﬀable aspects. We will use the term ‘simultaneous experience of e1 and e2’ as
an abbreviation for the statement that the experiencing subject in question has an experience
which includes both aspects e1 and e2. To give an example, let e1 refer to what it is like to taste
cheese and e2 refer to what it is like to smell wine. In this case, Assumption (A1) amounts
to granting the possibility of the experiencing subject in question simultaneously experiencing
what it is like to taste cheese and what it is like to smell wine.
Whether this experience
23The term ‘instant of time’ may refer to experiential instants of time or to instants of time as used
in physics, i.e. points t ∈R.

actually arises when the subject eats cheese and drinks wine is of no concern with respect to
Assumption (A1). We take the combination of the same experience e with itself as denoting the
experience of quale e but twice as intense (cf. below). In order to motivate a group structure
with respect to simultaneous experience, the following assumption is necessary:
(A2) We assume that there is a unique neutral quale which we denote by ‘0’. Furthermore,
we assume that for every quale e, there is a quale −e such that an experience which
includes both e and −e is not distinguishable from (and hence equal to) the experience
of the neutral quale.
It seems that this assumption is utterly beyond empirical justiﬁcation, since it invokes some-
thing like “cancellation” of ‘what is it like to be’ aspects of experiences, so that we may only
be able to ground a semigroup-structure of qualia with respect to combination (‘simultaneous
experience’). For the purpose of this example, we proceed nevertheless. We denote the simul-
taneous experience of two qualia e1 and e2 by ⊕, so that the ineﬀable aspect of the experience
which comprises both qualia labelled as e1 and as e2 established by Assumption (A1) is labelled
by e1 ⊕e2. Associativity and commutativity hold, so that we have:
◮(A1) and (A2) imply that ⊕: E × E →E is an abelian group.
Next, we model changes of intensity, as conceded in Phenomenological Axiom 3.14, by a
positive real number in the following sense: If e2 is the same quale as e1, but c times more
intense, then we denote e2 = ce1, where c ∈R+. For c ∈R−, ce1 is the opposite experience −e1
introduced in (A2), but experienced |c| times as intense as −e1, where |c| is the modulus of c.
Finally, we assume that as intensity decreases, c →0, any experience goes over to the neutral
quale, formally limc→0 ce = 0 for any e ∈E, where 0 denotes the neutral quale introduced
in (A2). Making the idealized assumption that a continuum of more and less intense versions
of any experience is possible, we have:
◮The intensity relation of Phenomenal Fact 3.14 may be taken to give rise to a scalar
multiplication ⊙: R × E →E.
As usual, we suppress the symbol ⊙for scalar multiplication. We need to check whether the
axioms of a vector space relating scalar multiplication and addition hold. Our interpretation
implies that 1e = e, hence neutrality of 1 ∈R holds. The two axioms of distributivity read
c (e ⊕e′) = (ce) ⊕(ce′)
and
(3.11)
(c + c′) e = ce ⊕c′e
for all c, c′ ∈R and e, e′ ∈E
(3.12)
Axiom (3.11) says that a c times more intense simultaneous experience of e and e′ arises as
the combination of c times more intense experiences of e and e′, respectively, which we take as
a plausible assumption in the context of this example. Axiom (3.12) sates a compatibility of
addition of intensities with combinations of experience. E.g., it says that an experience e′ which
is the same as another experience e but twice as intense, e′ = 2e can arise as the simultaneous
experience of the combination of e with itself. We render this axiom at least somewhat plausible
by deﬁning the combination of an experience with itself to be the same experience experienced
twice as intense. Finally, we note that the associativity axiom (c c′) e = c (c′e) is compatible
with our interpretation of ⊕and ⊙. We therefore have:
◮(E, ⊕, ⊙) satisﬁes the axioms of a vector space.
It remains to implement the the relation of similarity between qualia. As before, we idealize
and assume that there is a non-negative real number which speciﬁes how similar two qualia
e1 and e2 are.
We denote this number by ⟨e1, e2⟩.
If e1, e2 are not similar at all, we set
⟨e1, e2⟩= 0. If they are similar to some degree, we have ⟨e1, e2⟩> 0, where a larger value
implies more similarity. It seems natural to impose symmetry, ⟨e, e′⟩= ⟨e′, e⟩for all e, e′ ∈E.
An inner product furthermore satisﬁes
⟨e, e⟩= 0 ⇔e = 0
(Deﬁniteness)
⟨e, c e′⟩= c ⟨e, e′⟩
(Linearity)
⟨e, e′ ⊕e′′⟩= ⟨e, e′⟩+ ⟨e, e′′⟩

for all c ∈R and e, e′, e′′ ∈E. Out of those three axioms, only the last one seems reasonable to
some extent. It says that similarity is compatible with simultaneous experience: The similarity
between a quale e and the simultaneous experience of qualia e′ and e′′ is given by the sum of
the similarity of the quale e to each one of the qualia e′ and e′′.
Deﬁniteness says that the only quale which is not similar to itself is the neutral quale. This
seems rather problematic if one chooses the interpretation of 0 introduced in (A2). The ﬁrst
axiom of linearity says that the similarity between a quale e and a c times more intense version
of a quale e′ is given by c times the similarity between e and e′. As mentioned before, in order
to have a nice and clear example, we will accept also these assumptions for now, so that in
summary we have:
◮(E, ⊕, ⊙, ⟨., .⟩) satisﬁes the axioms of a inner product space or Pre-Hilbert space.
The inner product ⟨., .⟩introduces a norm on E as usual by ∥e∥=
p
⟨e, e⟩. This norm may be
interpreted as the intensity of a quale e.
The inner product space (E, ⊕, ⊙, ⟨., .⟩) may not be complete with respect to this norm,
meaning that there are Cauchy sequences in E which do not converge to an element in E.
In terms of qualia, this means that there are sequences of qualia whose elements become ever
more similar to each other but which do not converge to any quale in the topology speciﬁed
by the similarity relation. In order to exclude such cases, we consider the completion of E
with respect to the norm ∥.∥, which is unique up to isometric isomorphism. Alternatively, we
may assume that there is a ﬁnite number of classes of non-similar qualia, so that completeness
holds automatically. A complete inner product space is a Hilbert space. Denoting, as usual,
completion by a line over the corresponding quantities, we have:
◮The experience space E carries the structure of a real Hilbert space (E, ⊕, ⊙, ⟨., .⟩),
which we denote by HE.
Note that this is an abstract Hilbert space: Due to the ineﬀability of qualia, the elements of
the Hilbert space do not have an intrinsic collatable nature (as e.g. the case if one considers
function spaces). The automorphism group Aut(E) is the group U(HE) of unitary operators. ♦
4. Explanatory Gap
An “explanatory gap” [Lev83] between a phenomenon24 and natural science occurs
if the phenomenon has properties which render it incompatible with all notions of
explanation used in natural science. This is in particular the case if the phenomenon
violates a necessary condition for the application of any of these notions of explanation.
Explanatory gaps are taken by some to indicate or entail ontological gaps (cf. [Cha10,
Ch. 5, Sec. 3.4]). Whether this is legitimate or not is a question which we will not need
to address here. What matters for us is that if there is an explanatory gap, a change of
methodology is necessary if the phenomenon is to be addressed by scientiﬁc means.25
This change may or may not be motivated by ontological considerations.
Whether there is an explanatory gap or not strongly hinges on what one takes
scientiﬁc explanation to be. E.g., in [Cha96], it is assumed that explanations in natural
science can address “only structure and function, where the relevant structures are
spatiotemporal structures, and the relevant functions are causal roles in the production
of a system’s behavior” [Cha10, p. 105f.], which implies that phenomenal experience,
24Here, by ‘phenomenon’, we mean anything that occurs or manifests itself in a general sense,
including both scientiﬁcally observable “empirical phenomena” (such as data of an experiment) as
well as what is directly or indirectly perceived (experiences).
25This is not to say, of course, that every phenomenon can be addressed by scientiﬁc means. There
may be phenomena to which the scientiﬁc method cannot be applied. However, it seems that the only
way to establish whether this is the case for a particular phenomenon is to try to develop a suitable
methodology and, if successful, to apply it.

deﬁned in [Cha96] to consist of precisely those aspects of experience which do not
have a structure and function, cannot be explained by natural science. (For details, cf.
Appednix A.) While this axiomatic derivation of an explanatory gap is undoubtedly
important, the underlying notion of explanation is too narrow (Appendix B.3). This
calls both the explanatory gap and the grounding built on it into question.
This is diﬀerent for qualia as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.9. Since the deductive-nomological
model of explanation, the deductive-statistical model of explanation, the statistical rel-
evance model of explanation and the causal mechanical model of explanation all tacitly
presuppose that descriptions of the explanandum can be collated [Woo17], a thorough
explanatory gap exists between any scientiﬁc explanation and qualia as deﬁned here.
No scientiﬁc methodology in applied to date can be used to address non-collatable
aspects of experience.
Put in simple terms, this comes about from the fact that all explanations used in
natural science to date need to assume that the phenomenon under investigation is
intersubjectively accessible. Since our deﬁnition of qualia comprises those aspects of
experience which are not intersubjectively accessible, they cannot be addressed by the
standard methodology. There is no possibility at present in natural science to explain
why an experiencing subject experiences a particular quale over and above explanation
of the collatable relations between qualia.
Thus we conclude that a change of methodology is necessary if qualia are to be
addressed scientiﬁcally. The remainder of this article is devoted to developing this
change in methodology.
Our results show that mathematical tools can be devised
which allow us to address it. The resulting methodology generalizes Chalmers’ strategy
(outlined in Section A) and constitutes a formal framework for models of consciousness.
5. The Mathematical Structure of Models of Consciousness
Models of consciousness are hypotheses about how conscious experience and the
physical domain relate. In this section, we describe the general mathematical structure
these models may take making use of the minimally suﬃcient mathematical structure of
any formal scientiﬁc theory (Section 5.1) and of the epistemic asymmetry of conscious
experience (Section 5.2).
Finally, we introduce notation that will be used further
below. (Section 5.3).
5.1. Mathematical Structure of Scientiﬁc Theories. There are various diﬀerent
accounts in philosophy of science of what constitutes a scientiﬁc theory. Roughly, one
may distinguish syntactic accounts, semantic accounts and pragmatic accounts [Win16],
which diﬀer mainly in the role they attribute to mathematical formalization. Which
account of scientiﬁc theories is most adequate for the scientiﬁc study of consciousness
is yet to be seen.
The following list of formal ingredients is general enough to include any of the above-
mentioned accounts of what constitutes a scientiﬁc theory. In preparation, we remark
that a family (dt)t∈I is a function f : t 7→dt, which we will call “trajectory”.
It
describes the change of dynamical variables with respect to the parameter t. Needless
to say, the following list is not intended to be suﬃcient.
Deﬁnition 5.1. The mathematical structure of a scientiﬁc theory T comprises at
least:


## Page 28

J. KLEINER
◮A set of dynamical variables d. (Those quantities whose variation is determined
by T to some extent.)26
◮Some background structure b. (Variables, or general mathematical structures,
whose change is not determined by T. Background structure needs to be ﬁxed
in order to determine the variation of d in a particular application.)
The
variation or change of the dynamical variable of a theory can be expressed
with respect to some parameter t which takes values in some set I. Typically,
the parameter is assumed continuous and interpreted as time. However, this is
not necessary: The set I may or may not carry some mathematical structure
(such as a topology) and it may or may not be interpretable as time.
◮A set of kinematically possible trajectories K.
Sometimes, this includes all
possible trajectories, K = {(dt)t∈I}, but in many cases, trajectories need to
satisfy certain mathematical requirements, such as diﬀerentiability with respect
to the parameter t.
◮Some laws L. (Typically equations or variational principles, but L may also
include diﬀerent formal ingredients (such as those provided by category theory)
or even non-formal ingredients, as required by pragmatic accounts of scientiﬁc
theories.)
◮A set of dynamically possible trajectories D which we also call solutions of T.
These are those kinematically possible trajectories (D ⊂K) which are selected
by the theory’s laws in a particular application of the theory, given some choice
of background structure and possibly taking into account some “nonformal
patterns in theories” [Cra02, p. 55].
In the next section, we will put these ingredients of a scientiﬁc theory into connection
with the deﬁnitions introduced in Section 3.1. In doing so, we will have to distinguish
between a general theory T and those theories which have been put forward (or are
anticipated) by contemporary natural science. Similar to Chalmers’ use of the term
‘physical domain’ (Appendix A) we will refer to the latter as physical theories. We
will use the symbol TP to indicate one of these theories and denote its dynamical
variables, background structure, kinematically possible trajectories and solutions by
dP , bP, KP and DP . Finally, we will assume that the physical theories are formulated
in terms of a state space P, which is chosen such that according to the laws of TP , each
p ∈P determines a unique trajectory in DP . I.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence
between solutions (pt)t∈I ∈DP and states p ∈P.
We use the term model to denote a theory which is being proposed. This includes
full-ﬂedged theories which have not received the kind of empirical support usually
required in science, but also “toy-models”, which do not aim for a comprehensive
account of some class of phenomena, but rather serve to study some speciﬁc aspect of
it or to test a general idea of how the phenomena could be modelled.
Finally, for use in Section 6, we review the general deﬁnition of a symmetry group.
Note that K denotes the kinematically possible trajectories introduced above.
Deﬁnition 5.2. A group G is a symmetry group of a theory T [Giu09, p. 43] if and
only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
26We use the word ‘variable’ in a general sense here: A variable may represent something as simple
as a natural number just as well as an operator-valued ﬁeld on some manifold.

(a) There is an eﬀective27 action G × K →K of G on K.
(b) This action leaves the the solutions D of T invariant.
If φ is an action of G on K which satisﬁes the requirements (a) and (b), the pair (G, φ)
is a symmetry of T.
5.2. Models of Consciousness. We now apply Deﬁnition 5.1 to give a general ac-
count of what a model of consciousness is. To this end, we make use of the epistemic
asymmetry of conscious experience.
Epistemic asymmetry is name of the most fundamental epistemological problem
associated with conscious experience, namely that there “two fundamentally diﬀerent
methodological approaches that enable us to gather knowledge about consciousness:
we can approach it from within and from without; from the ﬁrst-person perspective
and from the third-person perspective. Consciousness seems to distinguish itself by
the privileged access that its bearer has to it” [Met95b]. The epistemic asymmetry
implies that there are two epistemically distinct notions of state, one associated with
the third person perspective and one with the ﬁrst person perspective.
Whereas metaphysical theories of mind may deal with only one of them, and leave
the relation to the other somewhat implicit, models of consciousness may not. Being
scientiﬁc hypotheses about how experience relates to the physical domain, the relation
of these two epistemically diﬀerent states is exactly what models of consciousness need
to address. Even if they take the third-person state to be fundamental (as in physicalist
ontologies), they need to give a description of how the ﬁrst-person state evolves in
time, i.e. why conscious experience appears to be what it is. And even if they take
the ﬁrst-person state to be fundamental (as in idealist ontologies), they need to give a
description of how the third person state evolves, i.e. why the outside world appears
to be what it is. The existence of these descriptions are what marks the diﬀerence
between formal ideas and scientiﬁc models.
The mathematical representation of phenomenal consciousness developed in Sec-
tion 3 is precisely what describes the ﬁrst-person perspective in formal terms, with
ﬁrst person states being elements e of the experience space E. A formal account of
third-person states, on the other hand, is provided by natural science, which is devoted
to the study of phenomena in the third person perspective in the ﬁrst place. Referring
to theories of natural science by and large as ‘physical theories’, the third-person states
are thus the states utilized in physical theories, e.g. states of neural networks or other
descriptions of the human brain. Using the notation introduced in the last section, we
denote physical theories by TP and their state space by P.
In summary, the above shows that in virtue of consciousness’ epistemic asymmetry,
a model of consciousness needs to prescribe a relation between states of experience and
physical states, independently of which ontology it seeks to express. In formal terms,
this means that it needs to prescribe a relation between the experience space E and
the state space P of a physical theory TP . Applying the minimal formal ingredients
of a scientiﬁc theory identiﬁed Deﬁnition 5.1, this means that the dynamical variables
of a model of consciousness are given by E × P or in fact En × P with n ≥1 in case a
model of consciousness can prescribe more than one experiencing subject for a given
physical state (as e.g. the case with Integrated Information Theory when making use
of the exclusion postulate [OAT14]). This is summarized in the following deﬁnition.
27An action is eﬀective (≡faithful) if and only if no group element other than the identity ﬁxes all
elements of K.

Deﬁnition 5.3. Let TP denote a physical theory. A pre-model of consciousness M is
a theory as in Deﬁnition 5.1, where:
(i) The dynamical variables are a Cartesian product of the physical state space P
of TP together with one copy of the experience space E for each experiencing
subject,
d = E × E × ... × E

{z
}
experiencing subj.
×P .
(5.1)
(ii) Kinematically possible trajectories K are a subset of families of dynamical
variables,
K ⊂

t , pt

t∈I
o
,
(5.2)
where ei
t ∈E, pt ∈P, n is the number of experience spaces in (5.1) and I is
some parameter space.28
We have dubbed this structure a ‘pre-model of consciousness’ since it does not yet
take into account any of the characteristic features of conscious experience, so that
the above mathematical structure may as well describe any other scientiﬁc theory that
addresses two variables that are epistemically distinct. An improved deﬁnition that
takes into account some of the characteristic features will be given in Section 6.2 below.
Note that by referencing a physical theory TP, this deﬁnition takes into account that
models of consciousness are built on and extend, or allow us to derive, physical theories.
An example for the former is again Integrated Information Theory (Section 8.1), and
example for the latter is Conscious Agent Network Theory (Section 8.3).
Further
examples are given in Section 8.
Implied by the above deﬁnition is that a model of consciousness M comes with
laws L which select from all kinematically possible trajectories K a set of solutions D.
Each solution (e1
t , e2
t , ... , en
t , pt)t∈I ∈D consists of families (ei
t)t∈I, which describe
changes of labels for every experiencing subject i ∈{1, ..., n}, and of a family (pt)t∈I,
which describes changes of the physical states. The solution thus realizes the mutual
inﬂuence of conscious experience and physical states as described by the laws of the
model M.
5.3. Notation. We conclude this section by providing a few abbreviations that will
be of use further below. We will generally use the shorthand
(¯et, pt)t :=
 e1
t , e2
t , ... , en
t , pt

t∈I ,
(5.3)
where ¯et = (e1
t , e2
t , ... , en
t ), to denote elements of K. Furthermore, we denote by D|P
those trajectories in the physical state space P which are part of solutions D of M,
D|P :=

(pt)t∈I
 (¯et, pt)t∈I ∈D
	
.
(5.4)
This set is not necessarily equal to the set DP of solutions of the contemporary physical
theory TP. Whether DP = D|P or DP ̸= D|P is determined by the laws L of the

 e1


t∈I to satisfy
some mathematical properties, such as regularity, which are necessary for the laws L of T to be well-
deﬁned. To exclude pathological cases, we assume that every label e ∈E is contained in at least one
family (e1
t, e2
t, ... , en
t , pt)t∈I ∈K.

K|P :=

(pt)t∈I
 (¯et, pt)t∈I ∈K
	
,
K|E :=

(¯et)t∈I
 (¯et, pt)t∈I ∈K
	
.
(5.5)
Since the choice of subset K in (5.2) is a technical condition prior to the application
of any law L, we may for simplicity assume that K|P = KP .
6. Taking Characteristic Features of Conscious Experience into
account
In the previous section, we have derived the general mathematical structure of any
model of consciousness. We have shown that consciousness’ fundamental epistemo-
logical feature has some implications regarding the formal structure of any scientiﬁc
theory that seeks to address it. However, we have not yet taken into account any of
the characteristic features of conscious experience.
The goal of this section is to do so. To this end, we work with the notion of non-
collatability introduced in Section 3. Since non-collatability is implied by ineﬀability,
privateness and cognitive, linguistic and communicative inaccessibility, the mathemat-
ical structure identiﬁed here is in fact a consequence of all of these characteristic
features.
Section 6.1, we drive formal mathematical structures of models of consciousness
which are necessary to account for non-collatability. In Section 6.2, we use the result to
give an improved deﬁnition of what constitutes a model of consciousness, and show by
means of an example that these structures are also suﬃcient to address non-collatable
aspects of experience. Finally, in Section 6.3, we compare the improved deﬁnition of a
model of consciousness with the direct description of qualia that may otherwise be used,
and show that when in comes to non-collatable aspects of experience, mathematical
models can achieve more than the direct description.
Together, these results show that the formal-mathematical tools developed here can
in fact address the explanatory gap between qualia and natural science identiﬁed in
Section 4. Therefore, this section provides the methodology for the grounding of the
scientiﬁc study of consciousness outlined in Section 3.4 when it comes to non-collatable
aspects of experience.
6.1. Non-Collatability implies Symmetry. In Section 3.1, we have discussed in-
tersubjectively meaningful references to qualia. We have found that sequences of labels
(e1, ... , en) are not empirically well-deﬁned and have shown that the empirically well-
deﬁned references to qualia are precisely the equivalence classes (3.8). We now repeat
a similar analysis for pre-models of consciousness. We ﬁrst introduce the necessary
mathematical tools.
Let s ∈Aut(E) be an element of the automorphism group (3.5) which describes the
freedom of an experiencing subject to choose labels for the qualia he/she experiences.
Given a solution (¯et, pt)t ∈D, we may apply s to that experience space in (5.1) which
is associated to the ith experiencing subject. This gives another trajectory

(6.1)

where i ∈{1, ... , n}. The map which takes (¯et, pt)t to (6.1) is an Aut(E)-action φi on
K, deﬁned as
φi : Aut(E) × K −→K

(6.2)
where the subscript i indicates on which experience space Aut(E) acts. We may take
into account the freedom of every experiencing subject to relabel his/her qualia by
considering an action φ of
Aut(E)n := Aut(E) × ... × Aut(E)
(6.3)
on K, deﬁned as
φ : Aut(E)n × K −→K

(6.4)
This action corresponds to the transformations we have considered in Section 3.2.
However, in the context of models of consciousness, this is not the most general form
of relabelling. The most general form is
σ : Aut(E)n × K −→K
 ¯s,

(6.5)
where similarly to (5.3) we have used the shorthand ¯s := (s1, ... sn), and where p′
t is
given by an action ˜σ of Aut(E)n on K|P ,
˜σ : Aut(E)n × K|P →K|P
 ¯s, (pt)t

7→(p′
t)t .
(6.6)
This action σ reduces to the action (6.4) if ˜σ is trivial. If ˜σ is non-trivial, σ speciﬁes
that the physical states are relabelled along with the qualia. We will see below (cf.
Section 6.3 for details) that the possibility of a non-trivial ˜σ is what allows us to go
beyond the standard methodology explained in Section 3.3.
Notation: In what follows, we will use the shorthand ¯s(¯et) := (s1(e1
t ), ... , sn(en
t )). As
usual, we denote σ
 ¯s, (¯et, pt)t

as σ¯s
 (¯et, pt)t

. Furthermore, we use k :=
 ¯et, pt

t ∈K.
Remark 6.1. We remark that each action σ of the form (6.5) has two diﬀerent mean-
ings: On the one hand, they describe a relabelling of the trajectory k. I.e., σ¯s(k)
describes the same situation as k but with respect to a diﬀerent choice of labelling.
This is the meaning we have considered in Section 3.1. It is analogous to a change of
reference frame in physics. On the other hand, k′ := σ¯s(k) is simply another trajec-
tory in K, which for ¯s ̸= id ∈Aut(E)n describes a scenario which is genuinely diﬀerent
to that of k. Whereas according to k, at time t experiencing subject i experiences
the quale he/she has labelled as ei
t and physical state pt pertains, according to k′
the experiencing subject experiences a quale he/she has labelled si(ei
t) and physical
state p′
t pertains. This is reminiscent of the distinction between active and passive
transformations in physics. Using this terminology we have:
1. Passive meaning of σ: k and σ¯s(k) are the same trajectory expressed in diﬀer-
ent labelling.
2. Active meaning of σ: k and σ¯s(k) are diﬀerent trajectories expressed in the
same labelling.


## Page 33


MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
33
The fact that active and passive transformation have an identical mathematical form is
related to the fact that qualia in virtue of their non-collatability cannot be referenced
intersubjectively.
♦
Next, we use the fact that k and σ¯s(k) describe the same trajectory with respect
to two diﬀerent choices of labels. Since a diﬀerent choice of labels must not make a
diﬀerence, it follows that if k is a solution of M, σ¯s(k) needs to be a solution as well,
for any choice of ¯s ∈Aut(E)n. This leads us to the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 6.2. A necessary condition for a pre-model of consciousness M to be em-
pirically well-deﬁned is that there is an Aut(E)n action (6.5) on K which maps solutions
to solutions, i.e. which satisﬁes
σ¯s(D) = D
(6.7)
for all ¯s ∈Aut(E)n.29
Using Deﬁnition 5.2, this yields the following lemma.
Lemma 6.3. A necessary condition for a pre-model of consciousness M to be empir-
ically well-deﬁned is that Aut(E)n is a symmetry group of M whose action is of the
form (6.5).
Proof. According to Deﬁnition 5.2, Aut(E)n is a symmetry of the model M iﬀ(6.5) is
eﬀective and leaves D invariant. Invariance holds by Deﬁnition 6.2. Eﬀectivity holds
because for large enough K (cf. Footnote 28) every action of the form (6.5) is eﬀective:
For any ¯s ∈Aut(E)n with ¯s ̸= id, there exists an ei
t ∈E such that si(ei
t) ̸= ei
t as well
as a trajectory k ∈K which contains this label, so that σ¯s(k) ̸= k.
□
If there are only collatable aspects of experience, the automorphism group Aut(E) is
trivial, so that (6.7) is satisﬁed. Therefore, in this case, all pre-models of consciousness
are empirically well-deﬁned. If there are non-collatable aspects of experience, however,
Aut(E) is non-trivial, so that (6.7) poses a condition that needs to be satisﬁed, and
Lemma 6.3 shows that the condition is in fact that there is an Aut(E)n symmetry.
Thus Lemma 6.3 establishes the mathematical consequences of non-collatability:
The need of an Aut(E)n symmetry in a model of consciousness. Since the existence of
a symmetry is dependent on the dynamical trajectories of a model of consciousness,
which are in turn determined by its laws L, the condition posed by the lemma is in
fact a requirement with respect to the model’s laws.
6.2. The Mathematical Structure of Models of Consciousness. In the previ-
ous section, we have found that the existence of an action (6.5) which constitutes a
symmetry is a necessary condition for a pre-model of consciousness to be empirically
well-deﬁned. We therefore need to include this requirement when specifying what con-
stitutes a general model of consciousness. The result is given in the following deﬁnition.
It speciﬁes the necessary structure of any model of consciousness which is to address
any non-collatable aspects of experience, e.g. ineﬀable, private or inaccessible aspects.
In particular, any model which aims to address any aspect of experience which is ref-
erenced by the Nagelian “what it is like” conception (Remark 3.11) necessarily needs
to carry this mathematical structure.
29Here, D is the set of solutions of M introduced above. Note that (6.7) states an identity of sets.
It is equivalent to σ¯s(k) ∈D for all k ∈D.


## Page 34

Deﬁnition 6.4. A model of consciousness is a pre-model of consciousness M as deﬁned
in Deﬁnition 5.3 which additionally carries an Aut(E)n symmetry of the form (6.5).
We remark again that the additional requirement relate to the laws L of a pre-model
of consciousness M; the laws need to be such that there is an action ˜σ which turns (6.5)
into a symmetry.
In Section 6.3, we will show that this framework indeed allows us to go beyond
the limitations of the standard approach explained in Section 3.3. To furthermore
make the point that this is a suﬃcient mathematical framework for the scientiﬁc study
consciousness (i.e. suﬃcient to study qualia proper, cf. Deﬁnition 3.19), we show in
the following example that a typical class of ideas put forward in the neuroscience of
consciousness can indeed be formalized in this framework: the idea that qualia are
determined by physical states.
Example 6.5. We consider the hypothesis that qualia are determined by physical states, e.g.
by neural activity in the brain. What exactly constitutes the determination does not matter
in what follows. Examples are type identity theory, where qualia are types of physical states,
or functionalism, where qualia are functional roles which are determined by physical states.
Another example is non-reductive functionalism [Cha95] where the physical states determine
functional roles, which in turn determine qualia via non-reductive laws of nature.
The naive formalization of this idea would be to consider a function (in the mathematical
sense) which speciﬁes which quale an experiencing subject experiences for each physical state
p ∈P. As we have seen in Section 3.1, the problem with this naive formalization is that qualia
cannot be referenced intersubjectively, so that the speciﬁcation of a function of this type is only
meaningful up to the equivalence (3.7). In order to properly formalize this idea, we proceed
as follows.
For simplicity, we consider the case of one experiencing subject (n = 1). We assume that a
particular labelling has been ﬁxed by the experiencing subject and assume that with respect
to this labelling a function
f : P →E
p 7→f(p)
(6.8)
is given, where P is the state space of a physical theory TP as above and E denotes the
experience space. This function expresses in which way qualia are determined by physical
states and could, ideally, be the result of experiments which include the experiencing subject
in question. The state space P could, e.g., refer to neural activity.
Based on this function f, we can deﬁne a pre-model of consciousness M. To this end, we
set d = E × P, choose K as the right hand side of (5.2) and deﬁne the solutions of the model
in terms of the solutions (pt)t ∈DP of the physical theory TP as
D =

(f(pt), pt)t
 (pt)t ∈DP
	
.
(6.9)
The solutions of this model are thus given by the solutions of the physical theory (e.g. brain
dynamics) equipped with qualia as speciﬁed by f.
As it stands, this model is not invariant with respect to relabelling. E.g., if the choice of
labels is being changed according to some s ∈Aut(E), the solution (f(pt), pt)t is being mapped
to the solution (s(f(pt)), pt)t which in general will not be an element of D as deﬁned in (6.9).
Thus the theory is not empirically well-deﬁned.
In order to establish empirical well-deﬁnedness, there are two choices: First, one could
demand that s(f(p)) = f(p) for all s ∈Aut(E) and all p ∈P. This amounts to considering
a function f : P →E\∼, where E\∼is as in (3.8), which does not achieve the task of
Deﬁnition 3.19. The alternative is to specify an action ˜σ as in (6.6), as we now explain.


## Page 35

The action ˜σ describes how the physical state changes along with a change of qualia (active
interpretation, cf. Remark 6.1). We observe that a deﬁnition of ˜σ as
˜σs

with
p′

= s(f(pt)). Thus if (p′
t)t is a solution of TP,
the action (6.5) with ˜σ as deﬁned in (6.10) is a symmetry of M, so that M is a model of
consciousness, i.e. empirically well-deﬁned.
Thus the idea that physical states determine qualia can indeed be formalized, even though
qualia are deﬁned to be non-collatable aspects of experience. The limitation of this approach
is that the function f, being deﬁned with respect to a particular choice of labelling of the
experiencing subject, cannot be interpreted as specifying the quale which the experiencing
subject experiences along with a particular physical state p.
Nevertheless, the formalism
allows us to treat the case that a quale, whichever one it is among the qualia in the equivalence
class [f(q)], is determined by the physical state p. Here, the equivalence class in question is the
one deﬁned in (3.7). A further analysis of the diﬀerence to a direct description will be given
in Section 6.3.
♦
We close this section by specifying the empirically well-deﬁned part of the trajecto-
ries of a model of consciousness M. This speciﬁcation is analogous to the speciﬁcation
of empirically well-deﬁned sequences in (3.6).
As in Section 3.1, we deﬁne two trajectories (¯et, pt)t and (¯e′
t, p′
t)t ∈K to be equivalent
if one can be obtained from the other by relabelling the qualia of the experiencing
subjects. In contrast to Section 3.1, relabelling is deﬁned in terms of the action (6.5),
which for non-trivial ˜σ includes a relabelling of the physical states. We denote this
equivalence by ∼σ,
(¯et, pt)t ∼σ (¯e′

Note that ˜σ, and hence σ, depends on the laws of the model M under consideration.
The empirically well-deﬁned part of the trajectories is given by the quotient set
K 
∼σ ,
(6.12)
i.e. by the the space of equivalence classes of ∼σ. This space describes the distinctions
which remain once all trajectories are identiﬁed which can be mapped to each other
by relabelling the qualia of the experiencing subjects.
6.3. Comparison with Direct Reference. In the previous sections, we have shown
that non-collatability implies that models of consciousness need to carry a particular
symmetry group in order to be well-deﬁned and that this allows us to address qualia
proper, i.e. individual non-collatable aspects of experience. In this section, we compare
the methodology so introduced with what may be called a ‘direct reference’ of qualia:
A description of experimental data or theoretical idea simply in terms of qualia’s labels,
without invoking any of the mathematical details introduced in Deﬁnitions 5.3 and 6.4.
Mathematically, a direct reference of the qualia of n experiencing subject is simply
a family
 e1

(6.13)

where I is some parameter space as above. For example, this could a time-series of
reports of experiencing subjects. Whereas a direct description may ignore the math-
ematical details of Deﬁnitions 5.3 and 6.4, it cannot ignore the ambiguity induced
by non-collatabiltiy of lables, which is fundamental and independent of any of the
mathematical tools introduced in Sections 5 and 6.
In Section 3.3, we have studied this ambiguity and what it implies for references
to qualia in detail, and found that the corresponding well-deﬁned statement is given
by (3.6). In the present notation, this reads
(¯et)t ∼(¯e′

if and only if there is an ¯s ∈Aut(E)n
such that e′

.
(6.15)
In order to compare this with a model of consciousness, we assume that one wishes to
relate (e.g. statistically analyse) the direct reference of qualia with some properties of
a physical system, e.g. neural activation patterns. We assume that these properties
are determined by states of the physical system and denote the state space as above
by P. Thus the data under consideration is of the form
 e1
t , ... , en
t , pt

t∈I .
(6.16)
It could result, e.g., from of verbal reports of experience and simultaneous fMRI scans
or EEG recordings.
In (6.12), we have found that the empirically well-deﬁned trajectories of a model of
consciousness are given by the quotient set
K 
∼σ .
(6.17)
The following lemma gives the corresponding result for the direct description.
Lemma 6.6. The empirically well-deﬁned trajectories of a direct description of qualia
are given by the quotient set
K
.
∼φ ,
(6.18)
where φ is the action (6.4) and where ∼φ is deﬁned as in (6.11).
This lemma states what a direct description of qualia can reference in light of non-
collatability. It expresses the epistemic constraints which ineﬀability, privateness, in-
accessibility and other characteristic features which imply non-collatability pose for
any theoretical or experimental account of consciousness.
The diﬀerence between (6.17) and (6.18) is that in (6.17) one takes the quotient with
respect to an action that generally acts non-trivially on the physical trajectories (pt)t,
whereas in (6.18) one takes the quotient with respect to an action that acts trivially
on the latter. We defer further discussion to after the proof.
Proof of Lemma 6.6. In terms of the notation (6.16), the equivalence (6.14) is given
by
(¯et, pt)t ∼(¯e′
t, p′
t)t
if and only if there is an ¯s ∈Aut(E)n
such that (¯e′
t, p′
t)t = φ¯s
 (¯et, pt)t

.
(6.19)
According to (6.11), this is precisely the equivalence ∼φ. Hence the empirically well-
deﬁned trajectories (6.15) are elements of the quotient set (6.18).

The quotient space (6.18) contains the empirically well-deﬁned trajectories that
can be referenced by a direct description of qualia in light of non-collatability. The
quotient space (6.17), on the other hand, gives the empirically well-deﬁned trajectories
of a model of consciousness. The diﬀerence between both is determined by the action ˜σ
deﬁned in (6.6), which describes how the physical states transform if one relabels the
qualia of an experiencing subject (passive meaning, cf. Remark 6.1), but also how the
physical states change if the qualia of an experiencing subject change (active meaning
in Remark 6.1). It is precisely the possibility of a non-trivial ˜σ which allows the laws
postulated by a model of consciousness to address individual qualia to a certain extent.
The extent to which this is possible is limited by the requirement that (6.5) constitutes
a symmetry of the Model M.
Mathematically, this is reﬂected in the fact that elements of (6.18) are of the form
 [(e1
t )t], ... , [(en
t )t], (pt)t

,
(6.20)
where each equivalence class [(ei
t)t] is as in (6.14) and (6.15). This coincides with our
result in Section 3.2 on references to qualia (cf. quotient space (3.8)). The elements
of (6.17), on the other hand, are not of this form: A non-trivial ˜σ results in equivalence
classes in which the physical states are mixed with the labels of the various experiencing
subjects. The empirically well-deﬁned trajectories cannot be separated as in (6.20).
This means that if one chooses a direct description of qualia and investigates the
relation to the physical domain, one ﬁrst has to consider equivalence classes (6.15)
(for only they are empirically well-deﬁned) and subsequently propose or analyse the
relation to the physical domain. Using a model of consciousness, one may exchange
this order: One may ﬁrst postulate a relation of qualia and the physical domain, and
subsequently remove the arbitrariness of choosing labels by considering equivalence
classes (6.11). The requirement of there being a symmetry σ simply makes sure that
this relation (the law L of a model of consciousness) is chosen in such a way that
the second step – obtaining an empirically well-deﬁned theory – is possible at all. A
non-trivial ˜σ implies that after the second step, one does not end up with what one
could have obtained using the ﬁrst procedure right away. This small detail can have
large empirical consequences.
Thus we have shown that models of consciousness are more powerful than direct
references in regard to the scientiﬁc study of non-collatable aspects of experience.
Since collatable aspects are always contained in our formalization as a special case
(trivial Aut(E)), we see that mathematical models of consciousness provide a suitable
methodology for the scientiﬁc study of consciousness which allows us to take the key
characteristics of ineﬀability, privateness and cognitive, linguistic and communicative
inaccessibility into account.
We conclude this section by remarking that Lemma 6.6 shows that if ˜σ is chosen as
trivial in Deﬁnition 6.4, the result is a direct description of qualia as referenced here.
Thus direct references constitute a special type of model of consciousness, and models
of consciousness are in fact a genuine generalization of direct references.
7. Closure of the Physical
Great care has been taken in the previous sections to motivate all constructions in
an operational, epistemological or phenomenological way, making sure that they are
independent of any metaphysical commitment. Metaphysical choices should only be
made when constructing individual models of consciousness. In this section, we make


## Page 38

a brief remark about a particularly important metaphysical choice, the closure of the
physical.
The closure of the physical is often called “causal closure of the physical” [Bis05]. It
denotes the idea that “physical laws already form a closed system” [Cha10, p. 17] and
is an important assumption which underlies many philosophical and scientiﬁc inves-
tigations of consciousness. We mention it here because, as explained in Appendix A,
Chalmers’ grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness needs to make use of the
closure of the physical in its deﬁnitions, which limits the applicability of this grounding
substantially (cf. Appendix B).
This is diﬀerent for the grounding put forward in Section 3. Since none of the basic
deﬁnitions or formal constructions refers to the closure of the physical in any way, this is
in fact an independent assumption which one may or may not make when constructing
models of consciousness. As a result, the conceptual and formal frameworks developed
here are suitable also to construct models of consciousness which express metaphysical
ideas such as dual aspect monism or property dualism that do not describe the physical
as closed.
In terms of the formalism developed in Sections 5 and 6, the assumption of the
closure of the physical can be stated in a particularly concise form.
Deﬁnition 7.1. A model of consciousness M describes the physical as closed if and
only if
D|P = DP ,
(7.1)
where D|P is deﬁned in (5.4) and where DP has been introduced in Section 5.1 to
denote the solutions of the physical theory TP which underlies the model M.
This deﬁnition says that a model of consciousness M describes the physical as closed
if and only if the physical trajectories which are determined by the laws of M (as part of
the solutions D) are, as a set, equal to the solutions of the physical theory TP which M
is based on. Whether or not (7.1) is satisﬁed depends on the laws L postulated by a
particular model.
This concludes our brief excursion to metaphysics. In the next section, we review
several examples and how they relate to the formalism introduced here. A conceptual
point about the closure of the physical is made in Appendix B.1.
8. Examples
In this section, we review some models of consciousness that have been proposed in
the literature and explain how they relate to the formalism introduced in Sections 5
and 6, and to the concepts introduced in Section 3.
8.1. Integrated Information Theory. Our ﬁrst example is Integrated Information
Theory (IIT) which has been proposed by Giulio Tononi in 2004 [Ton08] and has since
been developed considerably. The current version of that theory [OAT14] consists of
an algorithm whose input is a model of a physical system (together with a state of
that system and including its dynamical laws) and whose output are formal quantities
which give answers to the following three questions: 1. Which parts of the system are
conscious? 2. What are they conscious of? 3. How conscious are they?
To answer the ﬁrst question, the theory’s algorithm identiﬁes some (mutually dis-
joint) subsystems of the system. To answer the second question, for each such sub-
system S, the algorithm speciﬁes what is called a ‘maximally irreducible conceptual


## Page 39


MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
39
structure’ (MICS). This is a mathematical object of the following kind: Let PS be
the space of probability distributions (or probability measures) over the states of the
subsystem S. A ‘concept’ is an element of the space30
PCS := PS × PS × R+
0 .
The maximally irreducible conceptual structure is an n-tuple of concepts, where n is
determined dynamically by the theory and may vary from subsystem to subsystem.
I.e., it is an element of the “qualia space” [OAT14, graphical illustration in Figure 15]
ES := P×n(S)
CS
.
(8.1)
Finally, in order to answer the third question, the algorithm speciﬁes the integrated
conceptual information Φmax(S) ∈R+
0 . In summary:
“[T]he central identity [of IIT] is the following: The maximally irre-
ducible conceptual structure (MICS) generated by a [subsystem S] is
identical to its experience. The constellation of concepts of the MICS
completely speciﬁes the quality of the experience (...). Its irreducibility
Φmax speciﬁes its quantity.” [OAT14, p. 3].
The main papers of the theory remain somewhat silent about what exactly they
take the terms “consciousness” or “quality and quantity of an experience” [OAT14] to
mean. The ﬁrst observation is that ineﬀable aspects of conscious experience seem to
have played at least a small role in the early development of the theory. E.g., in [Ton08,
p. 229], Tononi notes that “[t]he notions just sketched aim at providing a framework
for translating the seemingly ineﬀable qualitative properties of phenomenology into
the language of mathematics” (our emphasis). As we have explained in detail in Sec-
tion 3.1, ineﬀable aspects of experience cannot be put in a one-to-one correspondence
with mathematical objects, simply because two or more experiencing subjects have
no means to ensure that they have associated the same ineﬀable aspect of experience
with the same mathematical object. This was the reason for us to introduce experience
spaces E via labels in Section 3.1 and what lead to the requirement of there being a
symmetry that describes relabelling. Following this path, we might take IIT’s “qualia
space” ES to constitute the experience space of qualia as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.9.
This brings us to the question of how collatable relations between qualia so deﬁned,
such as the ones put forward in Phenomenological Axiom 3.6, are related to the math-
ematical structure of the space ES. First, we note that the space ES can be equipped
with a metric: For any metric d on PS and using the usual metric on R+
0 , summation
allows us to deﬁne both a metric on PCS and ES. This metric can be taken to express
the similarity relation in Phenomenological Axiom 3.6. And indeed, this may again
have been a guiding idea in the development of the theory, “experiences are similar if
their shape is similar” [Ton08, p. 228]. Next, what has been called the “intensity” of
an experience in Example 3.15 corresponds to the “quantity” of experience according
to IIT. The corresponding mathematical structure is the R+
0 in which Φmax(S) takes
values.
IIT arguably encodes another collatable relation between qualia: Their composi-
tion in experience. This is usually formulated as an axiom of IIT which states that
30In the terminology of [OAT14], a concept consists of the maximally-irreducible cause and eﬀect
repertoires of a mechanism M of S together with its integrated information ϕ(M), provided that the
latter is non-zero [MMA+18, Supplementary S1, p. 176].


## Page 40

J. KLEINER
“[c]onsciousness is compositional (structured): each experience consists of multiple as-
pects in various combinations” [OAT14, p. 2]. The composition of the experience of a
subsystem S in terms of more elementary experiences of the same subsystem is mod-
elled by the Cartesian product structure of (8.1) in terms of the concept spaces PCS.
One may interpret the R+
0 that constitutes the last factor of PCS as the intensity of
the the more elementary experiences.
In summary, the basic deﬁnitions of IIT seem to ﬁt quite well with the basic deﬁ-
nition of the phenomenological grounding put forward in Section 3.4 and IIT can be
taken to constitute a pre-model of consciousness as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.3. How-
ever, in order to take into account the non-collatability of the corresponding aspects
of experience, the symmetry (6.5) has to be implemented. This can be done by simply
swapping the states of the physical system that give rise to particular labels e ∈ES:
If e1, ... en ∈ES are the labels of the conscious subsystems of a system in state p1,
and e′
1, ... e′
n′ ∈ES are the labels of conscious subsystems of the system in state p2,
for any ¯s ∈Aut(ES) which maps the former to the latter, we deﬁne the action (6.6)
as ˜σ¯s(p1) = p2. (For details, cf. Example 6.5.) Equipped with this symmetry, IIT
constitutes a model of consciousness as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.4.
We conclude this example with some conceptual remarks. First of all, we note that
the phenomenological grounding approaches model-building diﬀerently than [OAT14].
Whereas in the latter, phenomenological axioms are used to justify the deﬁnition of the
algorithm, i.e. the dynamical equations of IIT, the phenomenological grounding uses
phenomenological axioms to model the mathematical space associated with qualia. We
have seen above that an earlier version of IIT put forward in [Ton08] is more aligned
with this perspective. From the perspective of the phenomenological grounding, the
main task would be to motivate the mathematical structure of (8.1) in more detail.
E.g., one could ask why the elementary qualia are labelled by elements of the space
PS ×PS and not by a simpler metric space? Does the structure of the former have any
phenomenological interpretation? Questions of this sort may have large consequences
for the further development of the theory because the algorithm of IIT in its current
form makes essential use of elements of PS × PS.
Second, we remark that IIT describes the physical as closed: The dynamical evo-
lution of the physical domain is not changed in any way by the theory. Thus, if one
interprets the theory in Chalmers’ or the phenomenological grounding (or similar ones,
in fact31) the question arises of how the theory’s mathematical postulates – ﬁrst and
foremost the algorithm it speciﬁes – can be evaluated experimentally at all, for it seems
that all results one can hope to obtain from neuroscientiﬁc experiments that scan the
brain (EEG, fMRI, etc) are physical and therefore determined by the physical domain
alone. Put in simple terms, one may ask what one actually learns when collecting
experimental data that is in fact completely determined by the physical domain. This
argument is outlined in more detail in Appendix B.2 and related to the transcendental
argument against the closure of the physical given in Remark B.1. In Section 8.1.1,
we review a modiﬁcation of IIT which avoids this problem.
31This problem seems to appear in any grounding which exhibits an explanatory gap. One could
try to avoid the problem by interpreting (8.1) in terms of aspects of experience that do not exhibit an
explanatory gap. This, however, would raise the question of why a novel law (the algorithm of IIT)
should determine those aspects, as compared to some form of neural processing.

8.1.1. Integrated Information-Induced Quantum Collapse. To overcome the problem
mentioned in the last paragraph, one needs to propose a model of consciousness which
does not postulate the physical as closed. A ﬁrst model of this kind based on Integrated
Information Theory (IIT) is given in [KR15b]. It refers to an early version of IIT which
only answers the third question of Section 8.1: How conscious is a physical system?
The physical theory on which this model is based is a quantum system with Hilbert
space H and Hamiltonian H. The states are density matrices ρ ∈L(H). Given a
density matrix ρ, the Quantum Integrated Information is deﬁned as
Φ(ρ) = inf
n
S
 ρ
 ⊗N
i=1 Tri ρ
o
,
(8.2)
where the inﬁmum is taken over all decompositions of the Hilbert space H, i.e. over
all isomorphisms between H and a Hilbert space of the form H1 ⊗... ⊗HN, where
Tri ρ denotes the reduced density matrix on the Hilbert space Hi (i.e. Tri is a trace
over all Hj with j ̸= i) and where ﬁnally S(ρ∥ρ′) denotes the quantum relative entropy
deﬁned as
S(ρ∥ρ′) = Tr ρ log ρ −Tr ρ log ρ′ .
Here, Tr denotes the trace over the whole Hilbert space H. According to this model, (8.2)
speciﬁes how conscious the physical system is in the state ρ.
In order to specify how consciousness in turn inﬂuences the physical domain, the
model modiﬁes the time-evolution of the physical system. Whereas in quantum theory,
the time-evolution of a closed system with Hamiltonian H is determined by
∂ρ
∂t = −i
ℏ[H, ρ] ,
this models proposes the evolution equation

,
where hn,m(Φ(ρ)) are continuous functions of Φ(ρ) which vanish if Φ(ρ) = 0 and
where Lk are operators on H. This is a Lindblad evolution equation which describes,
among other things, models of spontaneous wave function collapse. By choosing the
functions hn,m suitably small, one can make sure that the model is compatible with
physical experiments to date.
The model is furthermore experimentally accessible
in that it predicts a collapse rate which is dependent on Φ(ρ), rather than mass or
the number of particles alone, as is the case in other spontaneous collapse models
(cf. [KR15b, Sec. 5]).
8.2. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory. The Global Neuronal Workspace model
(GNW) is, next to Integrated Information Theory, the other model largely favoured
by neuroscientists. In contrast to the latter, however, it is usually stated directly in
terms of brain physiology [DCN11, DKC98]. Even though this is suﬃcient to make
some speciﬁc predictions [DCN11], a more formal model would be desirable, not least
to make a detailed comparison with IIT possible.
In what follows, we outline how a formal model could be constructed which takes
as input any physical system (in a certain class of systems) and determines what the
system is conscious of. To this end, we apply concepts from dynamical systems and
nonbinary information processing whose connection with consciousness has recently
been suggested in [Gri18]. While this attempt is very preliminary, the hope is that a


## Page 42


42
J. KLEINER
genuine formal model can be developed along these lines in future work. A diﬀerent
goal is pursued in [Wal05].
Let S be a physical system. We assume that it consists of a set Nv of components
(‘vertices’, representing neurons in a neuronal network), each of which is in a particular
state ui(t). Here, t ∈I denotes time and i ∈Nv denotes the component in question.
Furthermore, we assume that it consists of a set Ne of directed edges (representing
axons, dendrites, synapses, etc. in a neuronal network), each of which may be in a
state wl(t), l ∈Ne, (e.g. representing the synaptic strength in a neuronal network).
As usual, we deﬁne the parents Pai of the ith component to be those components
from which a directed edge leads to i, and assume i ∈Pai. Finally, the dynamics
of the system are speciﬁed component-wise by a set of ‘update-rules’ (fi)i∈Nv, where
fi determines how the state ui(t) of the ith component depends on the states of its
parents and the states of the edges coming from its parents at previous times.
This system has conscious representations, according to the GNW model, if two nec-
essary conditions are satisﬁed. The ﬁrst of these is that the system has “two main com-
putational spaces, each characterized by a distinct pattern of connectivity” [DCN11,
p. 56].
The ﬁrst computational space is a “processing network, composed of a set
of parallel, distributed and functionally specialized processors or modular subsystems
subsumed by topologically distinct (...) domains with highly speciﬁc local or medium-
range connections” [ibid.]. The second computational space is a “a global neuronal
workspace, consisting of a distributed set of (...) neurons characterized by their ability
to receive from and send back to homologous neurons in other (...) areas horizontal
projections through long-range excitatory axons” [DCN11, p. 56].
In order to construct a formal model of consciousness based on this hypothesis, a
deﬁnition has to be given which speciﬁes which structure in a physical system counts
as a computational space of each kind, and which not; i.e. a deﬁnition of the necessary
“patterns of connectivity” in terms of the mathematical structure of a physical system.
In order to propose a such a deﬁnition, we combine the ideas of the GNW model with
some of the ideas put forward in [Gri18], using in particular the similarity between the
processing network described by GNW and the “global directed network consisting
of a large sparsely connected array of much smaller, irreducible subgraphs (ISGs),
representing directed neuron-to-neuron connections” put forward in connection with
consciousness in [Gri18]. Here, an ISG is deﬁned as follows.
[D1] A set NISG ⊂Nv of components of the physical system constitutes an irre-
ducible subgraph (ISG) if there is a directed edge between any ordered pair of
components in this set [Gri18, p. 25].
The similarity to the processing network of the GNW model comes about due to
the major observations in [Gri18] that each ISG “acts as an analog ﬁlter, a dynam-
ical decision-maker (preferring one or another resonant mode), an ampliﬁer, and a
router” [Gri18, p. 27]. In order to specify a necessary pattern for the global neuronal
workspace, we simply require that this is a network with a directed edge going into
and coming out of each ISG, noting that a further requirement on this network will be
added below. In summary, a proposal for the ﬁrst necessary condition for the system
S to be conscious may be put as follows.
[N1] The system S needs to contain two disjoint subsets Np, Ng ⊂Nv of components:
First, a set Np of components whose induced subnetwork is a network of ISGs,
were the inter-ISG-connections are feed-forward only.
Second, a set Ng of


## Page 43


MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
43
components with directed edges going from this set into all ISGs, and directed
edges going to this set from all ISGs.
Clearly, this deﬁnition is preliminary and will have to be improved substantially to
facilitate a full-ﬂedged model to be deﬁned.
In [Gri18], general properties of the state of ISGs are explained, which have been
found in previous work. In particular, if the system satisﬁes a few conditions, including
the feed-forward property mentioned in deﬁnition [N1], the ISGs will typically carry
out “successive pattern recognition tasks exploiting both remembered contextual in-
formation and prior expectations from past events (...) as well as the assumption of
the structures (elements) that are identiﬁed at [a] previous level” [Gri18, p. 30]. The
result of this task is recorded by a dynamical attractor on the ISG’s components,
which we denote by mk(t), where k indexes the ISGs in the system. These dynami-
cal attractors represent “perceived sources/objects, (...) events, (...) narratives, (...)
scenarios” [Gri18, Fig. 2].
Combining these results with the idea that “[t]he entire
workspace is globally interconnected in such a way that only one such conscious rep-
resentation can be active at any given time” [DCN11, p. 58], we arrive at a proposal
for the second necessary condition for the system to be conscious:
[N2] The induced subnetwork of Ng needs to be such that at any time t, its state
‘represents’ only one of the ISGs’ dynamical attractors mk(t).
Here, one could, e.g., deﬁne the term “represent” to mean that at any time t the state
of the network is (essentially) equal to one of the states mk(t), but other more realistic
choices might be possible.
If both necessary conditions [N1] and [N2] are satisﬁed at a particular time t, the
GNW model claims that the system S is conscious of the “perceived object, event,
narrative or scenario” mk(t) represented in the global workspace network Ng. Due to
the directed edges from Ng to the ISGs, the state of the ISG k may be made “directly
available in its original format to all other workspace processes” [DN01, p. 15].
Clearly, this outline leaves open various questions. Most notably, the question of
how modes mk(t) of ISGs may relate to experience. Whereas IIT’s qualia space (8.1)
has some structure which relates to phenomenology, it is highly questionable whether
this can be asserted of the states of ISGs, which behave generically like a small number
of “monotonically increasing phase variables” [Gri18, p. 25]. This very question arises
also, albeit in a more indistinct form, if GNW is formulated in terms of neuronal
architecture: How does a “piece of information selected for its salience or relevance to
current goals” [DCN11, p. 56], which is really just a state of some subset of the brain’s
neurons, relate to experience? A proposal to this extent is presented in Section 8.4.
Whereas from a formal modelling perspective, there is some space for further devel-
opment of the GNW model, it does seem to capture essential neuroscientiﬁc evidence
in a simple and very plausible hypothesis: The global workspace. This idea might
ultimately be combined with ideas of IIT or other models to give an explicit account
of how the state of the global workspace relates to experience as we ﬁnd it.
8.3. Conscious Agent Networks. A model which is based on idealistic metaphysics
is developed in [HP14]. The underlying idea is that what exists are interacting con-
scious agents, each of which has a fundamental capacity to perceive, decide and act,
and that the interaction between these conscious agents seems to each as if there is an
external outside world. For simplicty, in what follows, we explain a slight more general
version of the model than presented in [HP14].


## Page 44

In order to explain a single conscious agent C, we ﬁrst assume that there is a
space W which is external to the conscious agent. One may think of this as states
of some “world” which the agent perceives, but in fact this space is constituted via
interactions with other conscious agents, as explained below. Given this space W, a
conscious agent is modelled as a ﬁve-tuple C :=
 X, G, P, D, A

, where X and G are
spaces, and P, D, A are maps,32 interpreted as follows:
◮X is a space which describes possible experiences of the conscious agent. Each
element x ∈X represents a particular experience.
◮G is a space which describes describes dispositions or intentions to act.
Each
element g ∈G corresponds to an action the agent has decided to carry out.
◮P : W →X is a map which describes the agent’s “process of perception” [HP14,
p. 6]. It speciﬁes what the conscious agent experiences in response to the “world”
being in a particular state w ∈W.
◮D : X →G is a map which models how the experience of the agent determines its
disposition for an action, i.e. “the process of decision [in which] a conscious agent
chooses what actions to take based on the conscious experiences it has.” (ibid.).
◮A : G →W describes how the agent’s disposition for an action “is carried out”, i.e.
how it aﬀects the world: “In the process of action, the conscious agent interacts
with the world in light of the decision it has taken, and aﬀects the state of the
world” (ibid.).
The structure of the spaces W and X, as well as the deﬁnitions of the maps P, G
and A are not ﬁxed by the theory, but need to be chosen according to the applica-
tion.33 Based on such a choice, the model speciﬁes the dynamically possible trajectories
 x(t), g(t), w(t)

t∈I as those trajectories which satisfy
 x(t + 1), g(t + 1), w(t + 1)

=
 Pw(t), Dg(t), Aw(t)

,
where t is chosen as a discrete time parameter, i.e. I := Z.
The central hypothesis of this theory is called “conscious realism”: That “[t]he
world W consists entirely of conscious agents” [HP14, p. 7]. This hypothesis is imple-
mented via networks of conscious agents.
In order to describe a network of n conscious agents, we ﬁrst assume that for every
conscious agent, a space Xi of possible experiences and and a space Gi of dispositions
to act is given, as well as a “decision map” Di as introduced above. The “external
world” of the ith conscious agent is deﬁned to be the product of the action spaces of
all other conscious agents, i.e.
Wi := G1 × ... × Gi−1 × Gi+1 × ... × Gn .
This choice is motivated by the idealistic idea that what exists are only experiences
and dispositions to act, and that the dispositions to act of some agents determines the
experience of others. I.e., the process of perception of the ith conscious agent is, in
case of a network of conscious agents, given by a map
Pi : Wi →Xi .
32In [HP14], the speciﬁcation furthermore includes an integer N which counts perception-decision-
action cycles and hence acts as a type of internal “psychological” time, which however we simply
replace by the usual parameter t ∈I.
33In [HP14], some general assumptions are made: The spaces W , X and G are assumed to be
measurable spaces and the maps P, D and A are chosen to be Markovian kernels, so that for every
element of their domain, each map yields a probability distribution on their co-domain.

This allows us to deﬁne the dynamically possible trajectories of the network of con-
scious agents via
xi(t + 1) = Pi(g1(t), ... , gn(t))
and
gi(t + 1) = Dixi(t) .
If Pi is a partial function deﬁned only for some Gj ∈Wi, the ith agent is only able to
perceive the dispositions to act of the corresponding other conscious agents. Various
concrete proposals for how to choose Pi are discussed in [HP14, p. 7ﬀ.].
Due to the identiﬁcation of the “outside worlds” Wi of each conscious agent with the
dispositions to act of others, the action map Ai : Gi →Wi is not necessary to deﬁne the
dynamics. In order to satisfy the deﬁnition of a conscious agent given above one may
deﬁne it formally as the map which takes gi(t) to wi(t + 1) = (g1(t + 1), ... , gn(t + 1)).
In simple cases (e.g. involving two conscious agents [HP14]) this deﬁnition can be
ﬂashed out in terms of combinations of inverses of D and P. In general, it may require
Ai to be time-dependent.
In summary, the various objects the theory assumes in a particular application de-
termine (possibly in a probabilistic manner) the dynamics of a network of conscious
agents. The goal, then, is to specify plausible assumptions which allow us to deduce
formally that “the perception of objects and space-time can emerge from such dynam-
ics” [HP14, p. 1] and to “explore [the model’s] theoretical implications in the normal
scientiﬁc manner to see if they comport well with existing data and theories, and make
predictions that are novel, interesting and testable” [HP14, p. 7].
An early example of a result of this kind is given in [HP14, p. 13ﬀ.]. In a nutshell, it
is shown that if the state spaces Xi and Gi are ﬁnite, the dynamics of a network of two
conscious agents can be described in terms of an object which bears some similarity
to a quantum-mechanical wave function of a free particle.
From the perspective of models of consciousness as deﬁned in Section 6, two crucial
questions arise:
a) Whether the model would like to address aspects of experience which are non-
collatable.
b) Whether the theory would (eventually or in principle) like to make predictions
with respect to experiments which involve (reports of) conscious agents.
An aﬃrmative answer to the ﬁrst question might be indicated by the remark that the
“qualia X of a conscious agent C are private, in the sense that no other conscious agent
Ci can directly experience X” [HP14, p. 14]. If this is indeed the case, the mathematical
structure of the spaces Xi (and possibly also of Gi, if one holds that intentions to act are
also experiences of some sort) could be deﬁned based on a phenomenological analysis
as explained in Section 3.1. This would, in particular, dismantle the objection that
the “deﬁnition of conscious agents could equally well-apply to unconscious agents [so
that the] theory says nothing about consciousness” [HP14, p. 14].
More importantly, if the theory also answers aﬃrmatively to the second question,
the results of Section 6 show that a further mathematical structure is necessary to
ensure that the model is empirically well-deﬁned (Lemma 6.3).
8.4. Expected Float Entropy Minimisation. One of the largest questions at present
left open by the GNW model (Section 8.2) is how the state of the global neuronal
workspace, ultimately a collection of states of individual neurons, relates to experi-
ence.
Questions of this kind are addressed by the Expected Float Entropy (EFE)

model developed in [Mas16]. In short, this is a proposal for how (probability distribu-
tions of) brain states determine relations among qualia.
In what follows, we review the deﬁnition of this model. Every brain state is assumed
to consist of individual elements, each of which can be in a particular state. We denote
the set of all elements (“nodes”) by S and the space of states of each node by V , and
assume both are a ﬁnite set. A brain state is thus a map
s : S →V .
(8.3)
E.g., in a neural network, S is the set of neurons and V is the set of possible states
of each neuron. If applied to the GNW model as outlined above, S is the set Ng of
nodes and V denotes the corresponding space of states. In [Mas16], s is called a “data
element”, but we will refer to s simply as ‘state’.
Let ΩS,V denote the space of all states. We assume that a probability distribution p
is given over ΩS,V . The probability p(s) can be interpreted as the probability of the
brain being in state s.
A weighted relation on a set S is a map R : S × S →[0, 1]. Given a set of states
with corresponding probability distribution, the theory developed in [Mas16] allows
one to determine two weighted relations R and U, where R is a weighted relation on
the set S of nodes and where U is a weighted relation on the possible states V of each
node. We will discuss the interpretation of R and U at the end of this example.
The theory determines both U and R as follows.
For any state s ∈ΩS,V , the
composition U(s(.), s(.)) is a relation on S, which we denote as U ◦s. Deﬁne the ﬂoat
entropy fe and expected ﬂoat entropy efe as
fe(R, U, s) = log2

˜s ∈ΩS,V
 d(R, U ◦˜s) ≤d(R, U ◦s
	
(8.4)
efe(R, U, p) =
X
s∈ΩS,V
p(s) fe(R, U, s)
(8.5)
where s ∈ΩS,V , d is a distance function on the weighted relations on S and where |A|
denotes the cardinality of a set A. The theory proposes “that a system (such as the
brain and its subregions) will deﬁne U and R (up to a certain resolution) under the
requirement that the efe is minimized.” I.e. U and R are deﬁned via
efe(R, U, p) = min
¯R, ¯U efe( ¯R, ¯U, p) ,
(8.6)
where the minimum is taken over all relations ¯R on S and all relations ¯U on V .
(Existence or uniqueness of minimizers is not discussed in [Mas16].)
Concerning the interpretation of R and U, the theory proposes that if “a brain
state is interpreted in the context of all these relations (...), the brain state acquires
meaning in the form of the relational content of the experience”. If applied to the
visual cortex, the theory aims to explain “perceived relationships between diﬀerent
colours, the perceived relationships between diﬀerent brightnesses, and the perceived
relationships between diﬀerent points in a person’s ﬁeld of view (giving geometry)”.
These interpretations are supported by several examples in [Mas16], where the the-
ory is applied to pictures, so that S is the set of all pixels and V describes the possible
colour values at each pixel, which implies that U is a relation between colour values
and R is a relation between pixels. The support for these interpretations becomes
more diﬃcult when the theory is being applied, e.g., to the visual cortex, for in this
case U is a relation on the states of the nodes where the nodes could be individual


## Page 47

47
neurons or tuples of neurons in the visual cortex for example, and R is a relation on
the set of these nodes, making it somewhat unclear why in this case a relation U might
give an explanation of, e.g., why “blue appears similar to turquoise but diﬀerent to
red”.
One can, however, simply take the theory at face value by accepting that the relata
of U and R, whichever mathematical form they take, are (describing) non-collatable
aspects of experience and that U and R are (describing) the relations between them.
Here, the non-collatability is essential for otherwise the identity of some collatable
aspect of experience and elements of the set V or S would be questionable. In short, one
may assume that the relations R and U correspond to the structure of the experience
space E which describes experience.
Several interesting questions are raised by this model. First of all, we note that
since the model aims to explain the relations between aspects of experience, it is fully
compatible with a direct description of qualia as discussed in Section 6.3 and does
not aim for a description of qualia sensu stricto. This raises the question of whether
this model is an alternative to, or rather a complement of, models which do intent to
describe qualia sensu stricto, such as e.g. Integrated Information Theory.
One might conjecture that the relations among aspects of experience might in fact
be nuanced enough to allow us to identify individual qualia by speciﬁcation of the
relations. In other words, that all orbits of the automorphism group (3.5) are trivial.
Whether or not this is the case is a phenomenological question, which needs to be
answered by a systematic account of the relations between qualia found in experience
and is a priori to any model-building process (just like general properties of an ex-
planandum have to be ﬁxed prior to an explanation). However, since the EFE model
actually speciﬁes the relations between aspects of experience, one can also study which
answer the model itself gives to this question. The upshot of this analysis, which is
presented in the next paragraph, is that if the probability distribution p is invariant
with respect to a transformation (or permutation) of states, which is often the case,
the model does in fact specify relations whose automorphism group has non-trivial
orbits.
Consider a bijective transformation (permutation) of states σ : ΩS,V →ΩS,V which
can be speciﬁed in terms of a bijective transformation σS : S →S of nodes and in terms
of a bijective transformation σV : V →V of node-states, i.e. σ(s) := σV ◦s ◦σS. The
probability distribution p is invariant with respect to this transformation if p = p ◦σ,
i.e. if the transformation maps states s to states σ(s) which have the same probability
as the former, p(σ(s)) = p(s). Deﬁning the transformation of the relations U and R
as
U ′(., .) := U(σ−1
V (.), σ−1
V (.))
and
R′(., .) := R(σS(.), σS(.)) ,
(8.7)
and using the fact that the metric d is chosen as one of the dn metrics in [Mas16,
p. 127], i.e. involves summation over all elements of S×S, (8.4) yields that fe(R, U, s) =
fe(R′, U ′, σ(s)). Using the invariance of p and (8.5), this gives
efe(R, U, p) = efe(R′, U ′, p) .


## Page 48

J. KLEINER
This implies that for any minimizer R, U of (8.6), the pair R′, U ′ is a minimizer of (8.6)
as well.
In other words, the theory only determines minimizers up to transforma-
tions (8.7). Assuming uniqueness of minimizers, this in turn implies that the minimiz-
ing pair U, V satisﬁes
U(., .) = U(σV (.), σV (.))
and
R(., .) = R(σS(.), σS(.)) ,
(8.8)
so that σV and σS are relation-preserving bijections, i.e. non-trivial elements of the
automorphism group of the spaces (V, U) and (S, R), respectively.
Another interesting question is which part of the brain generates those relations
between aspects of experience which we ﬁnd in experience. This is, to a large extent, a
question which could be answered by simulations of the brain’s neuronal network. If it
turns out that these relations can be reproduced better by a distributed network, this
model may actually be compatible, or even taken as support of, the Global Neuronal
Workspace hypothesis. The underlying challenge here is, of course, to identify the
weighted relations R and U between (states of) neurons with the manifold relations
between aspects of experience. This identiﬁcation may also hinge on how the proba-
bility distributions p(s), which is the only data which enters the deﬁnition of R and
U, is interpreted when applied to the brain.
We conclude that this theory is an interesting approach to the mind-matter relation
which might complement more neuroscientiﬁc approaches such as the Global Neuronal
Workspace model. Depending on whether a phenomenological analysis conﬁrms that
there are qualia which cannot be distinguished by mere reference to collatable relations,
the model may or may not have to be extended in some form or the other to talk about
the hard problem of consciousness.
9. Conclusion & Outlook
Consciousness is in the focus of research projects around the globe. Empirical as well
as theoretical projects aim to investigate diﬀerent aspects of experience, ranging from
access consciousness or the unity of a conscious scene to phenomenal consciousness or
the ﬁrst-person-perspective [Set07]. The starting point of this paper is the observation
that if an aspect of experience is under investigation which cannot be identiﬁed over
several experiencing subjects (which cannot be collated), special care is necessary. Any
reference to such aspects of experience, be it in a theoretical account or when giving
reports, is ambiguous and this ambiguity may lead to ill-deﬁned models, erroneous
empirical predictions and misinterpretation of experimental data. A detailed summary
of results is given in Section 2.
In order to develop a well-deﬁned scientiﬁc methodology which can be applied to
all aspects of experience, we have used basic phenomenological axioms to specify how
a formal representation of experience can be constructed.
The result is a mathe-
matical space which represents some parts of experience (such as visual experiences
or auditory experiences) completely, including both the usual objects of investigation
in cognitive neuroscience as well as qualia. This formal representation of experience
avoids the usual hard cut between parts of experience which represent a diﬃculty for
the scientiﬁc methodology and parts which do not. Both are interwoven in our formal
representation, similarly to position and momentum being two aspects of a quantum
state.

We have shown that this mathematical representation of experience allows us to
quantify the ambiguity involved in any reference to experience precisely. This is suﬃ-
cient to avoid the problems mentioned above and yields a formal mathematical toolbox
which can be applied in empirical or theoretical investigations of consciousness.
In the second part of the paper, we have investigated how individual non-collatable
aspects of experience (qualia “sensu stricto” [OAT14]) can be studied scientiﬁcally.
Since there is a fundamental explanatory gap, this question may be considered as
equally relevant to the one addressed in the ﬁrst step.
The main result of the second part of this paper is that formal models of conscious-
ness can address individual non-collatable aspects of experience if and only if they
carry a speciﬁc symmetry group related to the mathematical representation of experi-
ence explained above. Because of mathematical details of the action of this symmetry
group, models of consciousness can be used to construct empirically well-deﬁned the-
ories of how individual aspects of experience relate to the physical domain despite the
ambiguity inherent in any reference to the latter.
The results of this paper constitute a grounding of the scientiﬁc study of conscious-
ness which is an alternative to other groundings currently in use. It oﬀers a thorough
conceptual and mathematical framework in light of which existing models of con-
sciousness can be interpreted and improved, and based on which new models can be
constructed.
This constitutes a ﬁrst step in developing a full-ﬂedged conceptual and mathemat-
ical foundation for models of consciousness. Further work is necessary to investigate
which mathematical structures are implied by other key characteristics of conscious
experience, most notably the various connotations of subjectivity and intrinsicality,
and to understand whether mathematical structure can be suﬃcient to account for
any of them.

Appendix A. Chalmers’ Grounding of the Scientific Study of
Consciousness
The most prominent grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness has been
developed by David Chalmers in [Cha96]. Since it is the blueprint of the grounding
proposes in Section 3, we review its essential deﬁnitions.
Note, however, that the
following outline of Chalmers’ grounding is intended to highlight the relations among
various constituents of his grounding and is not intended to be of an introductory
nature. A good and short introduction to this topic is [Cha10, Ch. 1].

J. KLEINER
First, we note that Chalmers’ deﬁnition of ‘physical domain’ includes what is often
called ‘material’ or ‘physical’ conﬁgurations, such as neurons or brain tissue, as well
as more fundamental physical notions such as “mass, charge, and space-time” [Cha10,
p. 17] or “atoms, electro-magnetic ﬁelds, and so on” [Cha96, p. 71]. We thus deﬁne
the term ‘physical domain’ to refer to all those phenomena which are currently consid-
ered to be the subject of a natural science (physics, chemistry, earth science, biology,
etc. [Wik18a]). Chalmers assumes that:
(A1) “The physical domain is causally closed.” [Cha96, p. 161]
“For every physical event, there is a physical suﬃcient cause.” [Cha96, p. 125]
Central to Chalmers’ grounding are the terms ‘function’ and ‘structure’.
“Here
‘function’ is not used in the narrow teleological sense of something that a system
is designed to do but in the broader sense of any causal role in the production of
behaviour that a system might perform” [Cha10, p. 6]. The term ‘structure’ is used in
a spatiotemporal sense. Together, they constitute, according to Chalmers, the notion
of explanation which is used throughout contemporary science: “One can argue that
by the character of physical explanation, physical accounts explain only structure and
function, where the relevant structures are spatiotemporal structures, and the relevant
functions are causal roles in the production of a system’s behavior.” [Cha10, p. 105f.]
We denote this notion of explanation by (E1).
Assuming some laws or theories
relating to the physical domain as given (= accepted by the scientiﬁc community by
and large) and referring to them as ‘accepted theoretical notions’, (E1) might be put
as follows:
(E1) An explanation speciﬁes the function and structure of an explanandum in terms
of the the function and structure of accepted theoretical notions.
The crucial aspect of Chalmers’ grounding is to establish, in a consistent and ex-
plicit way, that there are phenomena, related to consciousness, to which no function
or structure (as deﬁned above) can be associated. It follows that these phenomena
cannot be explained according to (E1) and hence, if (E1) indeed captures all notions
of explanations which are used throughout contemporary science, that they cannot be
explained by contemporary science. – There is an “explanatory gap” [Lev83, Cha96].
Chalmers refers to these phenomena as “phenomenal concepts”, “phenomenal quali-
ties” or “qualia” [Cha96].34 We refer to these phenomena as ‘phenomenal aspects of
consciousness’:
(D1) Phenomenal aspects of consciousness are those aspects of conscious experience
which do not have a function or structure, where ‘function’ and ‘structure’ are
as deﬁned above.
The key requirement for this deﬁnition of what is to be studied by a science of
consciousness to make sense is to establish that there are aspects of experience which
satisfy (D1), i.e. which neither have a spatio-temporal structure nor a causal role in
the production of behaviour. It is the second requirement with respect to which (A1)
is crucial, for (A1) can be utilized to argue that nothing non-physical can have a causal
inﬂuence on the physical domain. Therefore, all aspects of experience which do not
have a spatio-temporal structure (e.g. in the Cartesian sense of being non-extended
in space and space-time) automatically satisfy (D1). We will not review the various
34In [Cha10], he prefers to use the term ‘experience’: “Sometimes terms such as ‘phenomenal con-
sciousness’ and ‘qualia’ are also used here, but I ﬁnd it more natural to speak of ‘conscious experience’
or simply ‘experience.’ ” [Cha10, p. 5].


## Page 51

51
arguments which aim to prove the existence of phenomenal aspects of consciousness
at this point.
Put in terms of Deﬁnition 2.1, what is to be studied in the scientiﬁc study of con-
sciousness are, according to this grounding, phenomenal aspects of consciousness and
their relation to the physical domain. Since these are, by deﬁnition, not accessible
to the usual scientiﬁc methodology, Chalmers proposes that the task of a science of
consciousness is to ﬁnd what he calls “psychophysical laws” [Cha96, p. 127] which
relate the physical domain to phenomenal aspects of consciousness. Due to Assump-
tion (A1) and an underlying stance on the nature of causality “[t]hese laws will not
interfere with physical laws; physical laws already form a closed system. Instead, they
will be supervenience laws, telling us how experience [= phenomenal aspects of con-
sciousness] arises from physical processes” [Cha96, p. 127]. In combination with (E1),
this implicitly points at the major parts of the methodology to be used according to
this grounding.
Chalmers’ grounding raises several questions related to the deﬁnition and ontological
status of causality, to the validity of Assumption (A1), to the nature of experiments
in his grounding and to the validity of the subsumed notion of explanation, which we
discuss in Appendix B. The upshot is that there are severe conceptual problems which
make it questionable whether a scientiﬁc research program based on this grounding
can be carried out at all.
Furthermore, any scientiﬁc approach based on this grounding faces the question of
which mathematical structure one is to use in order to describe phenomenal aspects of
consciousness when formulating “psychophysical laws” [Cha96, p. 127]. Whereas the
physical domain comes with a clear-cut mathematical structure, Chalmers’ grounding
merely asserts that the phenomenal aspects form a set and oﬀers no systematic way
of tying additional mathematical structure to the phenomenology of experience.
This strongly suggest the construction of other groundings of the scientiﬁc study of
consciousness. In Section 3, we have introduced a possible alternative which avoids the
above-mentioned problems. Whereas this grounding breaks with several of Chalmers’
main ideas, it retains the key idea of addressing an explanatory gap with mathematical
tools.
Appendix B. Conceptual Problems of Chalmers’ Grounding
In this appendix, we brieﬂy discuss several conceptual issues of Chalmers’ grounding.
These issues are not motivated by metaphysical considerations and are not intended to
have metaphysical implications; they simply arise if one wishes to carry out a scientiﬁc
investigation of consciousness based on Chalmers’ grounding. Problems B.1 and B.2
are most crucial and might make it impossible to apply the grounding.
The abbreviations used below have been introduced in Appendix A. For reasons
explained in Appendix B.4, we assume that Assumption (A1) is intended to express
the fact that “physical laws already form a closed system” [Cha96, p. 127].
B.1. Closure of the Physical. Much has been written about Assumption (A1) both
by David Chalmers himself (e.g. [Cha96, Ch. 5] or [Cha10, Ch. 8 and 9]) and by others
(e.g. [Eli09] or [Bis05]). As noted in Section A, this assumption is crucial for Chalmers’
grounding in order to establish that there are aspects of experience which satisfy (D1).
To date, there is no valid argument which shows that Assumption (A1) is wrong,
i.e. that the physical laws of nature cannot “form a closed system”. On the other


## Page 52

hand, there also is no valid argument that shows that Assumption (A1) is right, i.e.
that the physical laws of nature must form a closed system.35 This assumption also
cannot be backed by analysing opinions or strategies of working physicists, for most
physicists are prepared to accept, or even try to ﬁnd, modiﬁcations of the known laws
of physics due to yet unknown phenomena (e.g. related to dark matter, to quantum
gravity or to dynamical collapse theories, to name just a few). They do not assume
that the known physical laws form a closed system. “Physics itself does not imply its
own causal closure nor is there any proof within physics of its own completeness, so
CoP [causal closure of physics] must be a metaphysical principle” [Bis05, p. 45].
Based on this state of aﬀairs, one might think that both Assumption (A1) as well
as its opposite should be compatible with a scientiﬁc approach to consciousness. How-
ever, this is not the case, as the following remark shows. Despite the fact that the
physical laws of nature may form a closed system, it seems that Assumption (A1) is
incompatible with a scientiﬁc approach to investigate consciousness because it violates
a necessary condition for the possibility of the latter.
Remark B.1. The phenomenological grounding developed in Section 3 allows one
to construct models of consciousness which postulate the physical as closed just as
well as models which do not postulate the physical as closed (several examples of
both are given in Section 8).
However, it seems that in both Chalmers’ and the
phenomenological grounding of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness, it does not make
sense to assume the closure of the physical because it violates a necessary condition of
the possibility of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness itself.
The goal of this remark is to explain in detail why this is so. To this end, we use the
symbol Q to denote that which is to be studied according to the grounding at hand:
In the case of Chalmers’ grounding (CG), Q refers to qualia as deﬁned in (D1) in
Appendix A, whereas in the case of the phenomenological grounding (PG), Q refers to
qualia as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.9. In both cases, Q thus refers to aspects of conscious
experience.
The above claim rests on two premises. First, that a scientiﬁc study of consciousness
is possible only if scientists can communicate about Q at least to some extent. E.g., they
need to be able to agree on Q’s deﬁnition and existence, need to be able to communicate
certain general properties of Q (such as Phenomenological Axioms 3.6, 3.12 or 3.14 in
the case of PG) or need to be able to record and exchange data related to Q. This
is the necessary condition for the possibility of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness
referred to above, which we abbreviate by NC.
The second premise is that communication is always mediated via communication
channels C which are elements of the physical domain. To give some examples, consider
verbal communication, which is mediated via sound waves, digital communication,
which is mediated via electromagnetic signals, or printed texts, where communication
is mediated via arrangements of molecules and electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Due to the second premise, an assumption concerning the closure of the physical
(ACoP) has something to say about communication channels and therefore also about
communication itself. If, in the grounding at hand, ACoP is ﬂeshed out in such a
way that it restricts the relation between Q and communication channels C to such
an extent that communication about Q is impossible, the above claim holds: By the
35Note that no reasons are given in either [Cha96] or [Cha10] for why Assumption (A1) should hold
true.

53
ﬁrst premise, this implies a violation of a necessary condition of the possibility of a
scientiﬁc study of consciousness.
Clearly, whether or not this is the case depends on what one takes to constitute
‘communication’ and which conditions one posits as necessary for something to count
as ‘communication about Q’. To ﬁnd proper answers to these questions is of course the
goal and task of various parts of philosophy. However, by restricting to a very simple
situation, we may hope to work with a necessary requirement for ‘communication about
Q’ to be possible which is acceptable independently of which notion of communication
one prefers.
The simple situation which we consider is the prototypical scenario of the mathemat-
ical theory of communication.36 I.e., we consider a situation where one experiencing
subject S1 (the ‘sender’) formulates a message m1 which expresses some properties
of her experience of Q, such as which particular phenomenal quality she has experi-
enced (in the case of CG) or whether two qualia are similar (in the case of PG).37
Subsequently, this message is being transferred via a communication channel C to an-
other experiencing subject S2 (the ‘receiver’), who after decoding the channel’s signals
obtains a message m2. We abbreviate this scenario by MTCp (‘p’ for ‘prototypical’).
We denote properties of S1’s experience of Q by q and states of the communication
channel C by c. In what follows, we consider functional dependencies between the
quantities q, c, m1 and m2. In order to deﬁne what constitutes a functional dependency
both mathematically and conceptually, we refer to the groundings under consideration:
Both CG and PG’s speciﬁcation of the task of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness
includes the formulation of laws or theories concerning the relation of Q with the
physical domain. Given enough further speciﬁcations (such as a model of the commu-
nication channel or more comprehensive physical laws), these laws or theories should
be applicable to the MTCp setup. I.e., we may assume that both PG and CG allow
one to construct (or even to deduce) mathematical models of the MTCp setup. The
details of any such model of course depend on various factors, most importantly on
which psychophysical laws (CG) or models of consciousness (PG) one considers. All
that matters at this point is that given any such model, we may identify functional
relationships between the quantities q, c, m1 and m2:
(F1) A quantity a ∈{q, c, m1, m2} is functionally dependent on a quantity b ∈
{q, c, m1, m2} according to some model of the MTCp setup iﬀaccording to
this model, a is a non-constant function of b.38
The reasons for focussing on functional dependency in order to argue for the main
claim of this remark are threefold.
The ﬁrst reason is that in both CG and PG,
ACoP implies a restriction of the functional dependencies which may hold between
the quantities q, c, m1 and m2. Consider ﬁrst CG. Here, the various formulations
of ACoP diﬀer slightly depending on whether they utilize a notion of causality or
not. However, it seems fair to say that they all intend to express the central claim that
“physical laws already form a closed system” [Cha96, p. 127]. Together with the second
36This is the original (and arguably more adequate [Flo17]) name for ‘information theory’ [Sha48].
37If this is impossible, i.e. if the assumptions of a grounding are such that an experiencing subject
cannot formulate a message which expresses some properties of her experience of Q, this grounding
violates the necessary condition NC as claimed. This may be the case for CG, cf. [Cha10, Ch. 9].
38Here, by ‘constant function’ we simply refer to functions which are formally dependent on b but
whose value remains the same independently of which value b takes. E.g., f(x, y) := x is a constant
function of y.

premise introduced above, this implies that in any model of the MTCp setup based
on CG, c cannot functionally depend on q. In PG, ACoP implies that any state c of
the communication channel is determined completely by the dynamics of the physical
theory TP , which does not include Q. Therefore, as is the case for CG, in PG ACoP
also implies that c cannot functionally depend on q:
(A2) In both Chalmers’ grounding (CG) and the phenomenological grounding (PG),
the assumption of the closure of the physical (ACoP) implies that the states c
of communication channels cannot be functionally dependent on q.39
The second reason is that functional dependency also seems to allow us to formulate
a fundamental necessary condition for ‘communication about Q’ to be possible:
(C1) A necessary condition for communication between S1 and S2 about Q is that
m2 may depend functionally on q.
The third reason, ﬁnally, is that the MTCp is intended to express functional relation-
ships in the ﬁrst place. In particular, it can be taken to imply by deﬁnition that m2 is
functionally dependent only on c and acquires additional functional dependencies only
via c’s functional dependencies.
This concludes the reasoning: A necessary condition of communication about Q in
the MTCp setup is that m2 is functionally dependent on q. By deﬁnition of the MTCp
setup it can only be functionally dependent on q via c. CG and PG’s ACoP however
imply that c cannot be functionally dependent on q. Therefore, a necessary condition
of communication about Q is violated, which by the ﬁrst premise above is a violation
of a necessary condition for the possibility of a scientiﬁc study of consciousness.
Clearly, this reasoning does not yet constitute a formal argument. Several of its
suppositions have to be checked carefully for hidden assumptions, which goes beyond
the scope of this remark.40
Nevertheless, it is of importance both with respect to
Chalmers’ grounding (where it raises a thorough problem) and with respect to the
phenomenological grounding (where it is a basis for potential empirical predictions).
We close this remark by pointing out that arguments which try to prove that the
closure of the physical cannot hold in light of empirical facts about our experience
(most notably written or verbal statements which express some fact about conscious
experiences, e.g. baﬄement about why consciousness exists [Eli09]) do not seem to
be valid. The problem is simply that we may appear to be expressing facts about
our conscious experience while in fact we are not. Similarly, we may appear to be
communicating about consciousness while in fact we are not. This is the basis for
Chalmers’ eﬀorts to develop a theoretical account of how judgements or statements
about consciousness can be accounted for despite the closure of the physical, cf. [Cha96,
Ch. 5] and [Cha10, Ch. 8 and 9].
39We emphasize again that the notion of ‘functional dependence’ is deﬁned by the respective ground-
ing under consideration. Thus it has a somewhat nomological ﬂavour and does not express, e.g., simple
covariation. The fact that both groundings contain notions of functional dependence is what allows
the present argument to be stated in a comparably concise form.
40To give one example: As explained in Footnote 39, this argument rests on the notion of functional
dependency contained in CG and PG in virtue of psychophysical laws or models of consciousness. In
using these, we have avoided the diﬃcult question of what a functional dependency actually expresses
(i.e. how it is supposed to be deﬁned and interpreted). E.g., when considering q, c, m1 and m2 as
variables, which sort of possible words do they describe? Logically possible worlds, conceivable worlds,
some sort of nomologically possible worlds? In what way can the assumptions of a grounding restrict
these possible worlds and what eﬀect does this have on functional relationships?

In contrast, the claim proposed in this remark simply represents a transcendental
argument: Independently of whether reality satisﬁes the closure of the physical or
not, it does not make sense to engage in a scientiﬁc study of consciousness if one
postulates the physical as closed, because the latter violates a necessary condition of
the possibility of the former.
♦
B.2. Experiments. An issue also arises with respect to experiments if one postulates
that “physical laws already form a closed system” [Cha10, p. 17]: Almost all experi-
ments one might wish to perform are rendered meaningless. The reason is simply that
most experimental data (fMRI scans, EEG signals, verbal reports, etc.) is stored on
physical devices (hard drives, paper, sound waves, etc.) and hence subject to physical
laws. If these are postulated to “form a closed system” it follows that the experi-
mental data must be determined by these physical laws alone, independently of which
“psychophysical law” [Cha96, p. 127] correctly describes how phenomenal properties
depend on physical properties.
To see this in more detail, let us assume that two diﬀerent psychophysical laws L
and L′ have been proposed. The idea behind Chalmers’ and in fact any conception
of the scientiﬁc study of consciousness is that experiments have to be carried out in
order to evaluate which of the proposals better describes reality. Accordingly, assume
that an experiment has been designed and carried out which purports to answer this
question, e.g. by checking predictions based on the laws L and L′. Finally, denote
by d the dataset produced by this experiment.
The term ‘data’ is applicable to any “putative fact regarding some diﬀerence or
lack of uniformity within some context” [Flo17], so that one might consider the case
where d actually consists of non-physical quantities, e.g. of diﬀerences in one’s own
experience.
However, as soon as the data is stored or processed as usual, e.g.
on
a hard drive in order to perform statistical analysis, the diﬀerences in question have
been transformed into “diﬀerence or lack of uniformity” of physical quantities. Since
almost all experiments, even when dealing with verbal reports or similar indications of
conscious experience, perform some sort of statistical analysis, it seems that in almost
all experiments, d eventually is a physical data set in this sense:41 It is ‘stored via’
physical quantities.
If one assumes that “physical laws already form a closed system” [Cha10, p. 17], it
follows that all physical quantities, as well the diﬀerences or lack of uniformity they
exhibit, are determined by the laws of physics alone. Applied to the physical quantities
on which d is stored, this statement literally says that the data d is determined by the
laws of physics alone. Put diﬀerently, due to the fact that the experimental data d is
stored on a physical device, closure of the physical implies that the data d is completely
independent of whether L or L′ or some completely diﬀerent psychophysical law best
describes how experience arises from physical processes.
Thus, in summary, the closure of the physical implies that whatever experiment one
performs in order to evaluate psychophysical laws, if it yields data that is stored on
physical devices, the result of the experiment is independent of how experience actually
arises from physical processes, i.e. independent of that which it seeks to study.
41If one assumes that communication between two experiencing subjects is mediated via com-
munication channels that are part of the physical domain (cf. Remark B.1), it follows that every
scientiﬁcally meaningful data needs to be transformed into physical data at some point.

This conclusion holds true even if we concede that every experiencing subject might
interpret the physical dataset d in terms of his/her own experience, so as to give
meaning to this set in a way that a philosophical zombie might not, simply because
if d is independent of which law E best describes how phenomenal properties arise
from physics, the meaning a scientist gives to d will generally be too.42
B.3. Subsumed Notion of Explanation. Chalmers’ grounding builds on, axioma-
tizes and extends the notion of an explanatory gap that has been introduced by Joseph
Levine in [Lev83]. To this end, Chalmers claims that a speciﬁc account of explanation
covers all notions of explanation that are used throughout natural science: An account
in terms of function and structure, cf. (E1) in Appendix A. He subsequently shows
that there are aspects of experience which do not have any of these two properties, so
cannot be explained in terms of natural science as usual. The gist of his grounding is
that they may be addressed by a “new sort of explanation” [Cha96, p. 121] which con-
sists of “new fundamental laws (...) specifying how phenomenal (or protophenomenal)
properties depend on physical properties” [Cha96, p. 127].
The question of how scientiﬁc explanation is to be deﬁned has occupied many
philosophers throughout the 20th century [Woo17].
To ﬁnd a deﬁnition which is
general enough to capture the various explanations in science, yet speciﬁc enough
to exclude scenarios which are clearly not cases of scientiﬁc explanation turns out to
be a very diﬃcult task. Even basic questions such as whether or not causality is to
feature in the deﬁnition of explanation (and if yes, which deﬁnition of causality), are
still largely debated: “There is considerable disagreement among philosophers about
whether all explanations in science and in ordinary life are causal and also disagree-
ment about what the distinction (if any) between causal and non-causal explanations
consists in.” [Woo17].
This sheds some doubt on Chalmers’ notion of explanation, and the question arises
whether (E1) really covers all, or even the most essential, uses of explanation through-
out sciences. This is particularly so with respect to physics, whose notion of expla-
nation seems to be a lot more formal than suggested by the terms ‘function’ and
‘structure’ as deﬁned here. E.g., physics does seem to provide notions of explanation
which can be applied to general dynamical quantities, whether they describe changes
in the behaviour of a system43 or changes of a more general sort. (Chalmers might
42One may be able to avoid this last conclusion by insisting that the meaning attributed to d
by any experiencing subject is dependent on the law E itself and if one furthermore argues that a
conclusion about which law E best ﬁts nature can be deduced from the meaning of d, despite d itself
being determined independently of the former. At the present stage it seems quite unclear how such
an deduction might work, let alone what role an experiment might play in this deduction in the ﬁrst
place.
43Recall that the term function refers to “any causal role in the production of behavior that a
system might perform” [Cha10, p. 6].
One could interpret this as referring to “any change in the
behavior of a system” (cf. Appendix B.4). This could, in turn, be taken to mean “any change in
the dynamical properties of a system”, which would change the meaning of the claim that “physical
accounts explain only structure and function” [Cha10, p. 105f.] to the following:
“Any account given in purely physical terms will suﬀer from the same problem. It will ultimately
be given in terms of the structural and dynamical properties of physical processes, and no matter how
sophisticated such an account is, it will yield only more structure and dynamics. While this is enough
to handle most natural phenomena, the problem of consciousness goes beyond any problem about the
explanation of structure and function [sic], so a new sort of explanation is needed.” [Cha96, p. 121]
However, most or even all aspects of consciousness are dynamical in nature, which implies that
the set of phenomenal aspects of consciousness (Deﬁnition (D1)) is, given this redeﬁnition of the term

57
even reluctantly agree to this last observation when claiming that “throughout the
higher-level sciences, reductive explanation works in just this [(E1)] way” [Cha10, p.
7], thus, in this quote, avoiding the claim that (E1) also applies to lower-level sciences,
such as (presumably) physics.)
This is a problem because the legitimacy of proposing “new fundamental laws”
which describe how phenomenal aspects of experience depend on physical properties
[Cha96, p. 127], as compared to a reductive explanation in terms of physical accounts,
is granted, in Chalmers’ grounding, by the existence of an explanatory gap between
phenomenal aspects and contemporary scientiﬁc explanation. If scientiﬁc explanation
is more powerful than Chalmers assumes, the justiﬁcation of this explanatory gap
breaks down and it becomes questionable whether this explanatory gap actually exists.
“[A]n explanatory gap (...) cannot be made more precise than the notion of explanation
itself” [Lev83, p. 358].
B.4. Causality. Finally, the question arises of what exactly one should take to con-
stitute causality when applying Chalmers’ grounding.
This is so because Assump-
tion (A1) as well as Deﬁnitions (E1) and (D1) all relate to causality in an essential
way (the latter via the deﬁnition of the term ‘function’, cf. Appendix A).
This question is widely debated both in physics and in the philosophy of causa-
tion [Sch16]. It seems fair to say that consensus is missing on basically all aspects of a
deﬁnition of causality, including basic questions such as which relata a causal relation
is to refer to and how, given a choice of relata, causality is deﬁned. Whereas this mul-
titude of possible notions of causality may not matter much if one is concerned with
philosophical investigations based on Chalmers’ grounding (one may just restrict to
analyses that apply to every notion of causality), it does matter if one wishes to apply
the grounding. In particular, if one wishes to model, let alone to identify, phenomenal
aspects of experience, one does need to know what exactly the Deﬁnition (D1) amounts
to. Since the term ‘function’ used in that deﬁnition refers exclusively to causality, the
deﬁning property of phenomenal aspects depends on what one takes causality to be.
Connected to questions of how to deﬁne causality is the question of the ontological
status of causality. Does some deﬁnition of causality pertain to “reality” or the uni-
verse? (In physicists’ terms: Is causality “fundamental”? Does the universe “obey”
one particular deﬁnition of causality?) Or is causality rather a tool which can be uti-
lized (by humans, animals, etc. or by information processing systems in general) to
describe some parts of reality well to some extent?44
Chalmers’ grounding is strongly dependent on which answer one gives to this ques-
tion. E.g., it determines which sort of “inﬂuence” of the phenomenal domain on the
physical domain is compatible with the deﬁnitions of the grounding, or which type of
‘function’, either empty or trivial. Put diﬀerently, with this redeﬁnition the grounding implies that all
or almost all of conscious experience can be addressed by an “account given in purely physical terms”.
What is left out are only non-dynamical aspects of experience (if there are such aspects at all).
44E.g., [Pea09] holds that “[i]f you wish to include the entire universe in the model, causality disap-
pears because interventions disappear – the manipulator and the manipulated lose their distinction.
However, scientists rarely consider the entirety of the universe as an object of investigation. In most
cases the scientist carves a piece from the universe and proclaims that piece in – namely, the focus
of investigation. The rest of the universe is then considered out or background and is summarized by
what we call boundary conditions. This choice of ins and outs creates asymmetry in the way we look at
things, and it is this asymmetry that permits us to talk about ‘outside intervention’ and hence about
causality and cause-eﬀect directionality.” [Pea09, p. 419f.] “What we conclude (...) is that physicists
talk, write, and think one way and formulate physics in another.” [Pea09, p. 407]

condition the deﬁnition of phenomenal aspects of consciousness constitutes. One may
ignore this problem as long as one applies the grounding to theories of the physical
domain which incorporate some notion of causality, such as, arguably, abstract neural
networks. However, if one wishes to apply the grounding to fundamental physical the-
ories, whose laws do not refer to, or come equipped with, any notion of causality, this
question cannot be ignored.
These issues can be avoided completely if one takes the various uses of the term
“causality” in Chalmers’ grounding to jointly mean that the physical domain is not
changed in any way by phenomenal aspects of consciousness, i.e., that the various uses
of causality simply amount to ensuring that the “physical laws already form a closed
system” [Cha96, p. 127]. This seems to be the actual intention of the author in [Cha96]
and [Cha10], which is why we have ﬁxed this interpretation in the beginning of this
appendix.
