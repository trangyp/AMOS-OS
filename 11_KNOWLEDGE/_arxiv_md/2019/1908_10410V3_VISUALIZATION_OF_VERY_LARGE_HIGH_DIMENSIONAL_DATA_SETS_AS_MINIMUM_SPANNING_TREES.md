Abstract 
The chemical sciences are producing an unprecedented amount of large, high-dimensional 
data sets containing chemical structures and associated properties. However, there are 
currently no algorithms to visualize such data while preserving both global and local features 
with a sufficient level of detail to allow for human inspection and interpretation. Here, we 
propose a solution to this problem with a new data visualization method, TMAP, capable of 
representing data sets of up to millions of data points and arbitrary high dimensionality as a 
two-dimensional tree (http://tmap.gdb.tools). Visualizations based on TMAP are better suited 
than t-SNE or UMAP for the exploration and interpretation of large data sets due to their tree-
like nature, increased local and global neighborhood and structure preservation, and the 
transparency of the methods the algorithm is based on. We apply TMAP to the most used 
chemistry data sets including databases of molecules such as ChEMBL, FDB17, the Natural 
Products Atlas, DSSTox, as well as to the MoleculeNet benchmark collection of data sets. We 
also show its broad applicability with further examples from biology, particle physics, and 
literature.

Introduction 
The recent development of new and often very accessible frameworks and powerful hardware 
has enabled the implementation of computational methods to generate and collect large high 
dimensional data sets and created an ever increasing need to explore as well as understand 
these data.1–9 Generally, large high-dimensional data sets are matrices where rows are samples 
and columns are measured variables, each column defining a dimension of the space which 
contains the data. Visualizing such data sets is challenging because reducing the 
dimensionality, which is required in order to make the data visually interpretable for humans, 
is both lossy and computationally expensive.10 
 
Large high-dimensional data sets are frequently used in the chemical sciences. For 
instance the ChEMBL database (𝑛= 1,159,881) of bioactive molecules from the scientific 
literature and their associated biological assay data are used daily in the area of drug 
discovery.11 Further examples of large databases containing molecules include FDB17 (𝑛=
10,101,204), a fragment-like subset of the enumerated database GDB17 listing theoretically 
possible molecules up to 17 atoms,12–14 and DSSTox (𝑛= 848,816), containing molecules 
investigated for toxicity.15 Examples of smaller data sets include the Natural Products Atlas 
(𝑛= 24,594), collecting microbially-derived natural products;16 Drugbank (𝑛= 9,300), 
listing molecules marketed or investigated as drugs;17 and the MoleculeNet benchmark, 
containing a collection of 16 data sets of small organic molecules.18 
To visualize such databases, simple linear dimensionality reduction methods such as 
principal component analysis and similarity mapping readily produce 2D- or 3D-
representations of global features.19–25 However, local features defining the relationships 
between close or even nearest neighbor (NN) molecules, which are very important to 
understand the structure of data, are mostly lost, limiting the applicability of linear

dimensionality reduction methods for visualization. The important NN relationships are much 
better preserved using non-linear manifold learning algorithms, which assume that the data 
lies on a lower-dimensional manifold embedded within the high-dimensional space. 
Algorithms such as nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA or autoencoders), t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and more recently uniform manifold 
approximation and projection (UMAP) are based on this assumption.26–28 Other techniques 
used are probabilistic generative topographic maps (GTM) and self-organizing maps (SOM), 
which are based on artificial neural networks.29,30 However, these algorithms have time 
complexities between at least 𝑂(𝑛1.14) and 𝑂(𝑛5), limiting the size of to be visualized data 
sets.31 The same limitations in terms of data set size apply when distributing data in a tree by 
implementing the neighbor joining algorithm or similar methods used to create phylogenetic 
trees.32,33 This limiting behavior has been documented by the ChemTreeMap tool, which can 
only visualize up to approximately 10,000 data points (molecules or clusters of molecules).34 
Due to the described challenges, large scientific data sets are generally visualized in 
aggregated or reduced form.35,36  
Here we present an algorithm, named TMAP (Tree MAP), to generate and distribute 
intuitive visualizations of large data sets in the order of up to 107 with arbitrary 
dimensionality in a tree. Our method is based on a combination of locality sensitive hashing, 
graph theory, and modern web technology which also integrates into established data analysis 
and plotting workflows. This tree-based layout facilitates visual inspection of the data with a 
high resolution by explicitly visualizing the closest distance between clusters and the detailed 
structure of clusters through branches and sub-branches. We demonstrate the performance of 
TMAP with toy data sets from computer graphics and with ChEMBL subsets of different size 
and composition, and show that it surpasses comparable algorithms such as t-SNE and UMAP 
in terms of time and space complexity. We further exemplify the use of TMAP for visualizing

Methods 
Given an arbitrary data set as an input, TMAP encompasses four phases: (I) LSH forest 
indexing,37,38 (II) construction of a 𝑐-approximate 𝑘-nearest neighbor graph, (III) calculation 
of a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the 𝑐-approximate 𝑘-nearest neighbor graph,39 and (IV) 
generation of a layout for the resulting MST.40 
During phase I, the input data are indexed in an LSH forest data structure, enabling 𝑐-
approximate 𝑘-nearest neighbor (k-NN) searches with a time complexity sub-linear in 𝑛. Text 
and binary data are encoded using the MinHash algorithm, while integer and floating-point 
data are encoded using a weighted variation of the algorithm.41–43 The LSH Forest data 
structure for both MinHash and weighted MinHash data is initialized with the number of hash 
functions 𝑑 used in encoding the data, and the number of prefix trees 𝑙. An increase in the 
values of both parameters led to an increase in main memory usage; however, higher values 
for 𝑙 also decrease query speed. The effect of parameters 𝑑 and 𝑙 on the final visualization is 
shown in Fig. S1. The use of a combination of (weighted) MinHash and LSH Forest, which 
supports fast estimation of the Jaccard distance between two binary sets, has been shown to 
perform very well for molecules.44 Note that other data structures and algorithms 
implementing a variety of different distance metrics may show better performance on other 
data and can be used as drop-in replacements of phase I. 
 
In phase II, an undirected weighted 𝑐-approximate 𝑘-nearest neighbor graph (𝑐-𝑘-
NNG) is constructed from the data points indexed in the LSH forest, where an augmented 
variant of the LSH forest query algorithm we previously introduced for virtual screening tasks 
is used to increase efficiency.45 The 𝑐-𝑘-NNG construction phase takes two arguments, 
namely 𝑘, the number of nearest-neighbors to be searched for, and 𝑘𝑐, the factor used by the 
augmented query algorithm. The variant of the query algorithm increases the time complexity

of a single query from 𝑂(log𝑛) to 𝑂(𝑘∙𝑘𝑐+ log𝑛), resulting in an overall time complexity 
of 𝑂(𝑛(𝑘∙𝑘𝑐+ log𝑛)), where practically 𝑘∙𝑘𝑐> log𝑛, for the 𝑐-𝑘-NNG construction. The 
edges of the 𝑐-𝑘-NNG are assigned the Jaccard distance of their incident vertices as their 
weight. Depending on the distribution and the hashing of the data, the 𝑐-𝑘-NNG can be 
disconnected (1) if outliers exist which have a Jaccard distance of 1.0 to all other data points 
and are therefore not connected to any other nodes or (2) if, due to highly connected clusters 
of size ≥𝑘 in the Jaccard space, connected components are created. However, the following 
phases are agnostic to whether this phase yields a disconnected graph. The effect of 
parameters 𝑘 and 𝑘𝑐 on the final visualization is shown in Fig. S2. Alternatively, an arbitrary 
undirected graph can be supplied to the algorithm as a (weighted) edge list. 
 
During phase III, a minimum spanning tree (MST) is constructed on the weighted 𝑐-𝑘-
NNG using Kruskal’s algorithm, which represents the central and differentiating phase of the 
described algorithm. Whereas comparable algorithms such as UMAP or t-SNE attempt to 
embed pruned graphs, TMAP removes all cycles from the initial graph using the MST 
algorithm, significantly lowering the computational complexity of a low dimensional 
embedding. The algorithm reaches a globally optimal solution by applying a greedy approach 
of selecting locally optimal solutions at each stage—properties which are also desirable in 
data visualization. The time complexity of Kruskal’s algorithm is 𝑂(𝐸+ log𝑉), rendering 
this phase negligible compared to phase II in terms of execution time. In the case of a 
disconnected 𝑐-𝑘-NNG, a minimum spanning forest is created.  
 
Phase IV lays out the tree on the Euclidean plane. As the MST is unrooted and to keep 
the drawing compact, the tree is not visualized by applying a tree but a graph layout 
algorithm. In order to draw MSTs of considerable size (millions of vertices), a spring-
electrical model layout algorithm with multilevel multipole-based force approximation is 
applied. This algorithm is provided by the open graph drawing framework (OGDF), a

modular C++ library.40 In addition, the use of the OGDF allows for effortless adjustments to 
the graph layout algorithm in terms of both aesthetics and computational time requirements. 
Whereas several parameters can be configured for the layout phase, only parameter 𝑝 must be 
adjusted based on the size of the input data set (Fig. S3). This phase constitutes the bottleneck 
regarding computational complexity. 
 
Results and Discussion 
TMAP performance assessment with Toy Data Sets and ChEMBL Subsets 
The quality of our TMAP algorithm is first assessed by comparing TMAP and UMAP to 
visualize the common benchmarking data sets MNIST, FMNIST, and COIL20 (Fig. 1). 
UMAP generally represents clusters as tightly packed patches and tries to reach maximal 
separation between them. On the other hand, TMAP visualizes the relations between, as well 
as within, clusters as branches and sub-branches. While UMAP can represent the circular 
nature of the COIL20 subsets, TMAP cuts the circular clusters at the edge of largest 
difference and joins subsets through one or more edges of smallest difference (Fig. 1a, b). 
However, the plot shows that this removal of local connectivity leads to an untangling of 
highly similar data (shown in dark green, orange, dark red, dark purple, and light blue). This 
behavior has been assessed and compared to UMAP in Figures S4 and S5, where it is shown 
that both TMAP and UMAP have to sacrifice locality preservation for more complex 
examples. For the MNIST and FMNIST data sets, the tree structure results in a higher 
resolution of both variances and errors within clusters as it becomes apparent how sub clusters 
(branches within clusters) are linked and which true positives connect to false positives (Fig 
1c, d, e, f).

of the TMAP visualizations at http://tmap.gdb.tools to see images associated with each point on the map. TMAP 
explicitly visualizes the relations between as well as within clusters. (a, b) While UMAP represents the circular 
nature of the COIL20 subsets, TMAP cuts the circular clusters at the edge of largest difference and joins clusters 
through an edge of smallest difference. (c, d, e, f) For the MNIST and FMNIST data sets, the tree structure 
allows for a higher resolution of both variances and errors within clusters as it becomes apparent how sub 
clusters (branches within clusters) are linked and which true positives connect to false positives. The image data 
of all three sets was binarized using the average intensity per image as a threshold.

In a second, more applied comparison example, we visualize data from ChEMBL using 
TMAP and UMAP. For this analysis molecular structures are encoded using ECFP4 
(extended connectivity fingerprint up to 4 bonds, 512-D binary vector), a molecular 
fingerprint encoding circular substructures and which performs well in virtual screening and 
target prediction.46–48 We consider a subset 𝑆𝑡 of the top 10,000 ChEMBL compounds by 
insertion date, as well as a random subset 𝑆𝑟 of 10,000 ChEMBL molecules.  
 
Taking the more homogeneous set 𝑆𝑡 as an input, the 2D-maps produced by each 
representation, plotted using the Python library matplotlib, illustrate that TMAP, which 
distributes clusters in branches and subbranches of the MST, produces a much more even 
distribution of compounds on the canvas compared to UMAP, thus enabling better visual 
resolution (Fig. 2a, b). Furthermore, in a visualization of the heterogeneous set 𝑆𝑟, nearest 
neighbor relationships (locality) are better preserved in TMAP compared to UMAP, as 
illustrated by the positioning of the 20 structurally nearest neighbors of compound 
CHEMBL3701602,49 reported as a potent inhibitor of human tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. 
The 20 structurally similar nearest neighbors are defined as 20 nearest neighbors in the 
original 512-dimensional fingerprint space. TMAP directly connects the query compound to 
three of the 20 nearest neighbors, CHEMBL3701630, CHEMBL3701611, and 
CHEMBL38911457, its nearest, second nearest, and 15th nearest neighbor respectively. The 
nearest neighbors 1 through 7 are all within a topological distance of 3 around the query (Fig. 
2c). In contrast, UMAP has positioned nearest neighbors 2, 3, 9, and 18, among several even 
more distant data points, closer to the query than the nearest neighbor from the original space 
(Fig. 2d). Indeed, TMAP preserves locality in terms of retaining 1-nearest neighbor 
relationships much better than UMAP, applying both topological and Euclidean metrics (Fig. 
2e, f; Fig. S6). The quality of the preservation of locality largely depends on parameter 𝑑, 
with adjustments to parameters 𝑘 and 𝑘𝑐 only having a minor influence (Fig. S7). Moreover,

TMAP yields reproducible results when running on identical parameters and input data, 
whereas results of comparable algorithms such as UMAP change considerably with every run 
(Fig. S8).26 
 
In terms of calculation times, TMAP and UMAP have comparable running time 𝑡 and 
memory usage 𝑎 for small random subsets of the 512-D ECFP-encoded ChEMBL data set 
with sizes 𝑛= 10,000 and 𝑛= 100,000, TMAP significantly outperforms UMAP for larger 
random subsets (𝑛= 500,000 and 𝑛= 1,000,000)  (Fig. 2h, i). Further insight into the 
computational behavior of TMAP is provided by analyzing running times for the different 
phases based on a larger subset (𝑛= 1,000,000) of the ECFP4-encoded ChEMBL data set 
(Fig. 2g). During phase I of the algorithm, which accounts for 180s of the execution time and 
approximately 5GB of main memory usage, data is loaded and indexed in the LSH Forest data 
structure in chunks of 100,000, as expressed by 10 distinct jumps in memory consumption. 
The construction of the 𝑐-𝑘-NNG during phase II requires a negligible amount of main 
memory and takes approximately 110s. During 10 seconds of execution time, MST creation 
(phase III) occupies a further 2GB of main memory of which approximately 1GB is retained to 
store the tree data structure. The graph layout algorithm (phase IV) requires 2GB throughout 
55s, after which the algorithm completes with a total wall clock run time of 355s and peak 
main memory usage of 8.553GB.  
 
Note that TMAP supports Jaccard similarity estimation through MinHash and 
weighted MinHash for binary and weighted sets, respectively. While the Jaccard metric is 
very suitable for chemical similarity calculations based on molecular fingerprints, the metric 
may not be the best option available to problems presented by other data sets. However, there 
exists a wide range of LSH families supporting distance and similarity metrics such as 
Hamming distance, 𝑙𝑝 distance, Levenshtein distance, or cosine similarity, which are

compatible with TMAP.50,51 Furthermore, the modularity of TMAP allows to plug in arbitrary 
nearest-neighbor-graph creation techniques or load existing graphs from files.

random sample 𝑆𝑟 (c, d, f), each of size 𝑛= 10,000, were drawn from the 512-D ECFP-encoded ChEMBL data 
set to visualize the distribution of biological entity classes and k-nearest neighbors respectively. (a) TMAP lays 
out the data as a single connected tree, whereas (b) UMAP draws what appears to be a highly disconnected

topological distance of 3 around the query compound. (d) The closest nearest neighbors of the same query 
compound in the UMAP visualization are true nearest neighbors 2, 3, 18, 9, and 1, with 1 being the farthest of

for a random sample (𝑛= 1,000,000) highlights the running time behavior of TMAP and allows an inspection 
of the time and space requirements of the different phases of the algorithm. Four random samples increasing in 
size (𝑛= 10,000, 𝑛= 100,000, 𝑛= 500,000, and 𝑛= 1,000,000) detail the differences in memory usage (h) 
and running time (i) between TMAP and UMAP (𝑡𝑇𝑀𝐴𝑃= 4.865s, 𝑎𝑇𝑀𝐴𝑃= 0.223GB; 𝑡𝑈𝑀𝐴𝑃= 20.985s,

TMAPs of small molecule data sets: ChEMBL, FDB17, DSSTox, and the Natural 
Products Atlas 
The high performance and relatively low memory usage of TMAP, as well as the ability to 
generate highly detailed and interpretable representations of high-dimensional data sets, is 
illustrated here by interactive visualization of a series of small molecule data sets available in 
the public domain. In these examples we use MHFP6 (512 MinHash permutations), a 
molecular fingerprint related to ECFP4 but with better performance for virtual screening tasks 
and the ability to be directly indexed in an LSH Forest data structure, which considerably 
speeds up computation for large data sets.45 
 
As a first example, we discuss the TMAP of the full data set of the ChEMBL database 
containing the 1.13 million ChEMBL compounds associated with biological assay data. 
TMAP completes the calculation within 613 seconds with a peak memory usage of 20.562 
GB. Note that approximately half of the main memory usage is accounted for by SMILES, 
activities, and biological entity classes which are loaded for later use in the visualization. To 
facilitate data analysis, the coordinates computed by TMAP are exported as an interactive 
portable HTML file using Faerun, where molecules are displayed using the JavaScript library 
SmilesDrawer (Fig. 3a).25,52 
 
Analyzing the distribution of molecules on the tree shows that TMAP groups 
molecules according to their structure and their biological activity, accurately reflecting 
similarities calculated in the high-dimensional MHFP6 space. This is well illustrated for a 
subset of the map (Fig. 3a, insert). In this area of the map, data points in cyan indicate 
molecules with a high binding affinity for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine 
neurotransmitters in two connected branches (right side of inset), while data points in orange 
show inhibitors of the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) (left side of inset),

and red and dark blue data points indicate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) ligands 
and cytochrome p450s (CYPs) inhibitors, respectively.

was merged with fragment database (FDB17) compounds (𝑛= 11,261,085) and visualized. FDB17 molecules 
are shown in light gray. The inset shows a branch of steroid and steroid-like ChEMBL compounds, as well as 
dominantly FDB17 branches which are sparsely populated by ChEMBL molecules. (c) Visualization of DSSTox 
compounds colored by reported toxicity level. The inset shows a subtree containing a high number of toxic 
compounds structurally similar or related to naphthalenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. (d) The 
Natural Products Atlas chemical space colored by origin genus of the 9 largest groups. The inset shows that 
structurally similar compounds are grouped into distinct branches and subbranches and are usually produced by 
plants and fungi from the same genus.

As a second example, we visualize the ChEMBL set merged with FDB17 (𝑛=
10,101,204) into a superset of size 𝑛= 11,261,085 (Fig. 3b), which corresponds to the 
largest data set that TMAP can successfully handle. As above, the TMAP 2D-layout 
accurately reflects structural and functional similarities computed in the high-dimensional 
MHFP6 space. In this TMAP visualization, the majority of ChEMBL compounds accumulate 
in closely connected clusters (branches) due to the prevalence of aromatic carbocycles. A 
notable exception is a relatively sizable branch of steroids and steroid-like compounds, which 
is connected to a branch of FDB17 molecules containing non-aromatic 5-membered 
carbocycles and ketones (Fig. 3b, insert). Many more detailed insights can be gained by 
inspecting the interactive map in Faerun (http://tmap-fdb.gdb.tools). 
 
Further examples include MHFP6-encoded compounds from the Distributed Structure-
Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database (𝑛= 848,816) and the Natural Products Atlas (𝑛=
24,594). Visualizing DSSTox and coloring the resulting tree by toxicity rating, TMAP creates 
several subtrees and branches representing structural regions with a high incidence of highly 
toxic compounds (shown in red, Fig. 3c). An example of such a subtree contains naphthalenes 
and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Fig. 3c, insert). The TMAP tree of the Natural 
Products Atlas was colored according to origin genus and reveals that branches and 
subbranches containing distinct substructures usually correlate with a certain genus such as 
various combinations of phenols, fused cyclopentanes, lactones and steroids produced by the 
fungi genus Ganoderma (colored purple in Fig. 3d, inset). 
 
Visualization of the MoleculeNet Benchmark Data Sets 
We further illustrate TMAP to visualize the MoleculeNet, a benchmark for molecular 
machine learning which has found wide adaption in cheminformatics and encompasses 16 
data sets ranging in size and composition (Table 1).18  As for the other small molecule data 
sets above, we computed MHFP6 fingerprints of the associated molecules and the

corresponding TMAPs, which we then color-coded according to various numerical values 
available in the benchmarks. The procedure was applied with all MoleculeNet data sets except 
for QM7/b, where no SMILES have been provided.  
 
The resulting TMAP representations, accessible at the TMAP website 
(http://tmap.gdb.tools), reveal the detailed structure of the data sets as well as the behaviour of 
methods applied to these data sets as a function of the chemical structures of the molecules. 
For example, TMAPs of the QM8 and QM9 (𝑛= 21,786 and 𝑛= 133,885), which contain 
small molecules and DFT-modelled parameters, reveal relationships between molecular 
structures and the various computed physico-chemical values. For instance the TMAP of the 
QM8 data set color-coded by the oscillator strengths of the lowest two singlet electronic 
states reveals how the value correlates with molecular structure and explains the performance 
differences in machine learning models trained on Coulomb matrices versus those trained on 
structure-sensitive molecular fingerprints.53 In the case of the ESOL data set containing 
measured and calculated water solubility values of common small molecules  (𝑛= 1,128), its 
TMAP color-coded with the difference between computed and measured values reveals the 
limitation of the ESOL model when estimating solubility of polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons and compounds containing pyridines. For the FreeSolv data set (𝑛= 642) 
containing small molecules and their measured and calculated hydration free energy in water, 
the TMAP visualization hints at possible limitations of the method when calculating hydration 
free energies of sugars. Finally, for the MUV data set (𝑛= 93,087), which contains active 
small drug-like molecules against 17 different protein targets mixed in each case with inactive 
decoy molecules, the various TMAPs reveal differences in the structural distribution of 
actives among decoys. Actives are usually well distributed but appear to form clusters in 
certain subsets (e.g. MUV-548 and MUV-846), explaining the generally higher performance 
of fingerprint benchmarks for these subsets.47

Application to other scientific data sets 
We further illustrate the general applicability of TMAP to visualize data sets from the fields 
of linguistics, biology, and particle physics. All produced maps are available as interactive 
Faerun plots on the TMAP website (http://tmap.gdb.tools).  
 
Our first example concerns visualization of the RCSB Protein Data Bank, which 
contains experimental 3D-structures of proteins and nucleic acids (𝑛= 131,236).54 The PDB 
files were extracted from the Protein Data Bank and encoded using the protein shape 
fingerprint 3DP (136-D integer vector, 256 weighted MinHash samples) 3DP encodes the 
structural shape of large molecules stored as PDB files based on through-space distances of 
atoms.22 Processing data extracted from the PDB and indexed using a weighted variant of 
MinHash, demonstrates the ability of TMAP to visualize both global and local structure, 
improving on previous efforts on the visualization of the database.22,55 The global structure of 
the 3DP-encoded PDB data is dominated by the size (heavy atom count) of the proteins (Fig. 
5a), on the other hand, the local structure is defined by properties such as the fraction of 
negative charges (Fig. 5b). 
 
As an additional example from biology, we consider the PANCAN data set (𝑛= 800, 
𝑑= 20,531), which consists of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumors 
(PRAD, KIRC, LUAD, COAD, and BRCA), randomly extracted from the cancer genome 
atlas database.56 Here we index the PANCAN data directly using the LSH Forest data 
structure and weighted MinHash. The output produced by processing the PANCAN data set 
displays the successful differentiation of tumor types based on RNA sequencing data by the 
algorithm (Fig. 5c). We also visualize the ProteomeHD data set using TMAP.57 This data set 
consists of co-regulation scores of 5,013 proteins, annotated with their respective cellular 
location. In addition to the ProteomeHD data set, Kustatscher et al. also released an R script 
to create a map of the set using t-SNE which took a total of 400s to complete; in contrast,

TMAP visualized the data set within 32 seconds (Fig. 5d), successfully clustering proteins by 
their cellular location based on co-regulation scores. As a further biology example, our TMAP 
webpage also features flow cytometry measurements (𝑛= 436,877,𝑑= 14), exemplifying 
the methods application for the visualization of relatively low dimensional data.17,58

associated with each point. 3DP-encoded PDB entries visualized using TMAP with weighted MinHash indexing, 
the color bars show the log-log distribution of the property values. (a) Colored according to the macromolecular 
size (heavy atom count). The resulting map reflects the size-sensitivity of the 3DP fingerprint. (b) Colored 
according to the fraction of negative charges in the molecules. Macromolecules with a high fraction of 
negatively charged atoms, predominantly nucleic acids, are visible as clusters of red branches. (c) The PANCAN 
data set (n=801, d=20,531) consists of gene expressions data of five types of tumors (PRAD, KIRC, LUAD, 
COAD, and BRCA) and was indexed using a weighted variant of the MinHash algorithm. (d) Visualization of 
the ProteomeHD data set (n=5,013, d=5,013) based on co-regulation scores of proteins. The data points have

As an example from physics, we represent the MiniBooNE data set (𝑛= 130,065, 
𝑑= 50), which consists of measurements extracted from Fermilab’s MiniBooNE experiment 
and contains the detection of signal (electron neutrinos) and background (muon neutrinos) 
events59. As the attributes in MiniBooNE are real numbers, we use the Annoy indexing library 
which supports the cosine metric in phase I of the algorithm to index the data for 𝑘-NNG 
construction, which demonstrates the modularity of TMAP.60 This example reflects the 
independence of the MST and layout phases of the algorithm from the input data, displaying 
the distribution of the signal over the background data (Fig. 6a). 
 
Outside of the natural sciences, we exemplify TMAP to visualize the GUTENBERG 
set as an example of a data set from linguistics. This data set features a selection of 𝑛= 3,036 
books by 142 authors written in English.61 To analyze this data, we define a book fingerprint 
as a dense-form binary vector indicating which words from the universe of all words extracted 
from all books occurred at least once in a given book (yielding a dimensionality of 𝑑=
1,217,078), and index this book fingerprint using the LSH Forest data structure with 
MinHash. The visualization of the GUTENBERG data set exemplifies the ability of TMAP to 
handle input with extremely high dimensionality (𝑑= 1,217,078) efficiently (Fig. 6b). The 
works of different authors tend to populate specific branches, with notable expected 
exceptions such as the autobiography of Charles Darwin, which does not lie on the same 
branch as all his other works. Meanwhile, the works of Alfred Russel Wallace are found on 
subbranches of the Darwin branch. 
 
Related to linguistics, the TMAP webpage further features a map of the distribution of 
different scientific journals (Nature, Cell, Angewandte Chemie, Science, the Journal of the 
American Chemical Society, and Demography) over the entire PubMed article space (𝑛=
327,628, 𝑑= 1,633,762), perceiving specialization, diversification, and overlaps; as well as 
a TMAP of the NeurIPS conference papers (𝑛= 7,241,𝑑= 225,423), visualizing the

increase in occurrence of the word “deep” in conference paper abstracts over time (1987-
2016).

(𝑛= 130,065, 𝑑= 50) consists of measurements extracted from Fermilab’s MiniBooNE experiment. TMAP 
visualizes the distribution of the signal data among the background. (b) The GUTENBERG data set is a selection 
of books by 142 authors (𝑛= 3,036, 𝑑= 1,217,078). The works of five different authors are shown to occupy 
distinct branches. Interactive version of these maps and further examples can be found at http://tmap.gdb.tools. 
 
Conclusion 
In this study, we introduced TMAP as a visualization method for very large, high-dimensional 
data sets enabling high data interpretability by preserving and visualizing both global and 
local features. By using TMAP in combination with the MHFP6 fingerprint, we can visualize 
databases of millions of organic small molecules and the associated property data with a high 
degree of resolution, which was not possible with previous methods. TMAP is also well-
suited to visualize arbitrary data sets such as images, text, or RNA-seq data, hinting at its 
usefulness in a wide range of fields including computational linguistics or biology.  
 
TMAP excels with its low memory usage and running time, with performance superior 
to other visualization algorithms such as t-SNE, UMAP or PCA. By adjusting the available


## Page 20

parameters and leveraging output quality and memory usage, TMAP does not require 
specialized hardware for high-quality visualizations of data sets containing millions of data 
points. Most importantly, TMAP generates visualizations with an empirical sub-linear time 
complexity of 𝑂(𝑛0.931), allowing to visualize much larger high dimensional data sets than 
previous methods.  
  
 
All the TMAP visualizations presented, including installation and usage instructions, 
are available as interactive online versions (http://tmap.gdb.tools). The source code for TMAP 
is available on GitHub (https://github.com/reymond-group/tmap) and a Python package can 
be obtained using the conda package manager.

Fig. S3 Influence of parameter 𝒑 on visualization of MNIST. The point size parameter 𝑝 has major influence 
on the aesthetics of the visualization, as it controls the sparseness of the drawn tree. Decreasing the point size and 
thus the repulsive force between two points, allows the layout algorithm to draw points closer to their respective 
(sub) branches.

UMAP. (a, b, c) Colored by the points x-components in the original 3-dimensional Euclidean space, (d, e, f) 
colored by longitude. (a) Randomly distributed points picked from the surface of a 2-sphere were embedded on 
the two-dimensional plane by TMAP (b) and UMAP (c) using an angular metric in 0.859s and 2.96s wall-clock 
time respectively. Both algorithms were run with their respective nearest neighbor parameters set to 10. The 
results clarify the intrinsic need to break locality when embedding unbounded closed surfaces. (d) The location 
of cities with a population higher than 1,000 (𝑛= 47980) mapped to a sphere. (e) TMAP and (f) UMAP 
embeddings of the city-representing points in a 2D plane. The colors roughly represent Europe and Africa 
(green), India and central Asia (yellow), east Asia (orange), Oceania (red), and the Americas (blue). Using a 
Euclidean metric, the execution time of the algorithms was 18.566s and 218.528s, respectively. A detailed view 
of the Bering Strait (white arrows) in original 3D space with TMAP edges added (g) embedded by TMAP (h) 
and UMAP (i) highlights the differences between the two approaches. As laying out a graph is vastly more 
complex than laying out a tree, UMAP produces embedding errors such as the placement of Sardinian cities 
surrounded by North American cities (red arrow).

Fig. S5 Locality-preservation in 2D embeddings of 𝒏-spheres by TMAP and UMAP. Random points were 
uniformly picked from the surface of (𝑛−1)-spheres with 𝑛∈{3, 10, 100, 1000}. In addition, the number of 
points were varied between 100 and 1,000. These examples represent edge cases due to the nature of high 
dimensional hyperspheres. For each point, the 10 nearest neighbors in the original 𝑛-dimensional space were 
compared to their ranked distance in the 2-dimensional plane. As the topological distance cannot be directly 
compared to the two Euclidean distances given the very high likeliness of collisions at any given (topological) 
distance due to branching, the average topological distance between any two points was included (blue dashed 
line).The quality in locality preservation of both TMAP and UMAP degenerates quickly in higher dimensions, 
however, TMAP tends to preserve the two nearest neighbors even when embedding very high dimensional data.

TMAP preserves more than 80% based on topological and more than 35% based on Euclidean distance.

Euclidean measure of locality preserving performance, parameters 𝑘 and 𝑘𝑐 have only marginal influence (c, d). 
The point size 𝑝 does not influence topological distances; however, it has a minor effect on the Euclidean 
distance-based metric, as higher values increase the sparsity of the drawn tree.

the results yielded by UMAP show considerable differences between each run.
