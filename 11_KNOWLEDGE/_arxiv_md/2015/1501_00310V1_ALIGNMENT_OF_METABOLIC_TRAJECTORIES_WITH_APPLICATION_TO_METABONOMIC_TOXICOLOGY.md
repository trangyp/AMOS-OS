Abstract: 
 
Geometry of the metabolic trajectories is characteristic of the biological response 
(Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Yet, due to unavoidable inter-individual variations, the 
exact trajectories characterising the biological responses differ. We examined whether 
the differences seen between metabolic trajectories of a specific treatment, correspond 
to the variations seen in the other biological manifestations of the same treatment. 
Differences in trajectories were measured via alignment procedures which introduced 
and implemented in this study. Our study revealed strong correlation between the 
scales of the aligned trajectories of metabolic responses and the severity of the 
hepatocelluar lesions induced after administration of hydrazine. Thus the results 
confirm that aligned trajectories are characteristic of a specific treatment. They then 
can be used for comparison with other treatment specific or unknown metabolic 
trajectories and can have many metabonomic applications such as preclinical 
toxicological screening

1. Introduction 
 
High expectations of rapid drug discovery in post-genomics era via mining the wealth 
of the genome data proved to be rather optimistic due to the complexity of disease 
biology and the fact that identifying a target does not necessarily reveal what the 
target does or how it works. Research and development cost of new drugs continues 
to rise above general price inflation while approval rates fall (DiMasi, Hansen et al. 
2003). These rather disappointing facts pronounce the importance of better 
understanding of biological responses to various signals not only based on relying on 
transcriptomic information, but also considering much broader perspective 
encompassing proteomics (Blackstock and Weir 1999) and some 
metabonomics(Nicholson, Lindon et al. 1999) data increase efficiency of drug 
discovery and development efforts (Butcher, Berg et al. 2004). Figure 1, extracted 
from a published paper (Lindon, Holmes et al. 2003), schematically demonstrate 
relationships between the genome and the technologies for evaluating changes in gene 
expression (transcriptomics), protein levels (proteomics), and small molecule 
metabolite effects (metabonomics). Some of the main categories of resources 
available to develop an ideal system capable of pre-clinically prediction of 
compounds having toxicity and unfavourable pharmacokinetic profiles before are 
structure–activity relationships (SAR) computational models based on compound 
structure; ‘pattern’ databases of tissue or organ response to drugs, compiled from 
high-throughput experiments such as COMET (Lindon, Keun et al. 2005) project; and 
‘systems biology’ databases of metabolic pathways, genes and regulatory networks 
(Bugrim, Nikolskaya et al. 2004). Metabolite profiling has already been used 
throughout clinical development for discovery of clinical safety biomarkers 
(Nicholson, Connelly et al. 2002). 
 
Metabonomic expert systems capable of predicting the probability of novel drug 
candidates being toxic employ series of mathematical models can be constructed 
operating at three levels i.e. classification of ‘normal’ samples, classification of 
samples of known toxicity or disease as described within a pre-existing database, and 
identification of biomarkers of pathology (Parzen 1962; Holmes, Nicholson et al. 
2001; Holmes and Antti 2002). These models may include e.g. neural network(Parzen

1962)-based methods (D. S. Broomhead 1988; Bishop 1995), non-linear approaches 
such as probabilistic neural networks (PNN)(Specht 1990), non-neural 
implementation of probability classification technique (Ebbels, Keun et al. 2003) 
and/or PCA-based methodologies.  
1.1. 
The ‘Omics’ approach 
 
The 'Omics' interrelationship can be symbolised by a study (Sharabiani, Siermala et al. 
2005), which shows during cellular responses and in many biological systems, gene 
expression strongly correlates with amino acid composition, physicochemical, and 
structural properties of proteins as well as the functional, cellular localization and 
gene ontology parameters of proteome. Figure 1, extracted from a published paper 
(Lindon, Holmes et al. 2003), schematically demonstrate relationships between the 
genome and the technologies for evaluating changes in gene expression 
(transcriptomics), protein levels (proteomics), and small molecule metabolite effects 
(metabonomics).  
 
Omics-integration (i.e. genomics, proteomics and metabonomics) can characterise the 
response of living organisms to chemical exposure or other stimuli in terms of gene 
and protein expression as well as metabolic regulation and provide mechanistic and 
somewhat quantitative information which can be used to incorporate toxicological 
data at earlier stages of drug development, potentially saving millions of dollars 
(Burchiel, Knall et al. 2001; Aardema and MacGregor 2002; Keun, Ebbels et al. 2002; 
Tennant 2002).

the genome and the technologies for evaluating changes in gene expression (transcriptomics), 
protein levels (proteomics), and small molecule metabolite effects (metabonomics) 
 
Omics techniques have been adopted by pharmaceutical industry to complement the 
traditional approaches of target identification and validation, and experimental 
analysis of traditional hypothesis-based methods (Butcher, Berg et al. 2004). 
Metabonomics can provide information in a non-invasive or minimally invasive 
manner through biofluids, such as blood plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (Lindon, 
Holmes et al. 2003) . Compared to the rest of omics technologies, which measure the 
intermediate steps in the response of the organism to the xenobiotics, has the 
important advantage of dealing with the ‘end points’ of protein action (Lindon, 
Holmes et al. 2003; Bugrim, Nikolskaya et al. 2004). 
1.2. 
Metabonomics & Metabolomics 
 
Although the terminology is still evolving, metabonomics has been defined as 
“quantitative measurement of time-related multi-parametric metabolic responses of 
multi-celluar systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification” 
(Nicholson, Lindon et al. 1999) or “measure of the fingerprint of biochemical 
perturbations cause by disease, drug or toxins”(Goodacre, Vaidyanathan et al. 2004) 
or it can be viewed as “the process of defining multivariate metabolic trajectories that


## Page 7


1-7 
describe the systemic response of organisms to physiological perturbations through 
time”(Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Metabonomics, an application-deriven science, has 
its roots in metabolite profiling (analysis focused on a group of metabolites e.g. those 
associated with a specific pathway (Fiehn 2002)) initially appeared in literature in 
1950s (Rochfort 2005),. Metabolite profiling in a wider range is called metabolomics, 
defined as comprehensive analysis of the whole metabolome under a given set of 
conditions (Fiehn 2002; Goodacre, Vaidyanathan et al. 2004). The technologies 
commonly exploited for different metabolomic strategies are shown in Figure 2 
extracted from a published paper (Goodacre, Vaidyanathan et al. 2004).  
 
General strategies for metabolome analysis. CE, capillary electrophoresis; 
DIESI, direct-infusion ESI, which can be linked to Fourier transform ion cyclotron 
resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS);
NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; RI, refractive index detection; UV, ultraviolet 
detection

for metabolome analysis  
 
 
NMR as well as Mass Spectroscopy (MS) is useful tools in metabonomics. NMR is 
non-destructive and cheap. With no major sample preparation, biofluids can be 
analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which can provide valuable 
information on metabolites (Lindon, Holmes et al. 2003; Nicholson and Wilson 2003).

1-8 
The NMR-based metabonomic data have presented a high degree of stability without 
compromising the diagnostic power to identify the source and effects of confounding 
variation (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2002). MS is more sensitive than NMR and therefore 
can detect much smaller concentrations of metabolites. MAS (magic angle spinning) 
NMR(Andrew 1984) can be used in intact tissues for instance to correlate patterns of 
metabolic perturbation in the tissues with changes in the biofluid profile which often 
gives powerful insights such as defining diagnostic set of non-invasive biomarkers of 
toxicity and characterising the biochemical composition of healthy and diseased 
tissues (Cheng, Lean et al. 1996; Cheng, Ma et al. 1997; Millis, Maas et al. 1997; 
Moka, Vorreuther et al. 1997; Tomlins, Foxall et al. 1998; Garrod, Humpfer et al. 
1999; Bollard, Garrod et al. 2000; Waters, Garrod et al. 2000; Garrod, Humpher et al. 
2001).  
 
Metabonomics recently has become a major focus of research in various areas 
(Kanehisa, Goto et al. 2002) especially indications of drug toxicity which is 
particularly addressed (Ellis, Broadhurst et al. 2002; Famili, Forster et al. 2003; 
Forster, Famili et al. 2003; Wilson and Nicholson 2003; Rochfort 2005). The COMET 
(Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology) project is probably the biggest 
coordinated effort in metabonomics aimed at studying xenobiotic toxicity rigorously 
and comprehensively using mainly 1H NMR spectroscopy to classify the biofluids in 
terms of known pathological effects caused by administration of substances causing 
toxic effects (Lindon, Nicholson et al. 2003) 
 
Five major pharmaceutical companies namely Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Eli Lilly & Co., 
Hoffman-La Roche, NovoNordisk, Pfizer Inc. and The Pharmacia Corporation (now 
within Pfizer) and Imperial College London, UK took part in the consortium aiming at 
generating a metabonomic database of the effects of 147 model toxins and other 
treatments. ~500 000 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of rodent urine 
and blood serum and developing a predictive expert system for target organ toxicity 
(Lindon, Nicholson et al. 2003; Lindon, Nicholson et al. 2003; Lindon, Keun et al. 
2005).

1.3. 
Statistical analysis & Expert systems in 
toxicological screening: 
 
Multivariate statistical methods were initially introduced to metabolomics to analyse 
to simply to classify objects (e.g. 1H NMR spectra of biofluid samples) according to 
their origin (i.e. the site or mechanism of toxic exposure). (Gartland, Beddell et al. 
1991; Holmes and Antti 2002). As metabolomics applications and objectives evolve, 
the range of statistical methodologies being introduced to metabonomics increases 
and diversifies. A wide range of PCA based methods such as partial least squares 
(PLS) or PLS-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), batch processing (BP), soft 
independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) have been developed and employed 
in metabonomic studies. Other method also include nonlinear mapping procedures 
(NLM), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), probabilistic models, probabilistic neural 
networks (PNN), as well as non-neural implementation of probability classification 
technique, various scaling techniques, geometric classification analysis, ANOVA-
simultaneous component analysis (Nicholson, Buckingham et al. 1983; Gartland, 
Beddell et al. 1991; Anthony, Sweatman et al. 1994; Nicholson, Foxall et al. 1995; 
Robertson, Reily et al. 2000; Ebbels, Lindon et al. 2001; Holmes, Nicholson et al. 
2001; Lindon, Holmes et al. 2001; Nicholls, Holmes et al. 2001; Waters, Holmes et al. 
2001; Waters, Holmes et al. 2001; Antti, Bollard et al. 2002; Azmi, Griffin et al. 2002; 
Brindle, Antti et al. 2002; Ebbels 2002; Ellis, Broadhurst et al. 2002; Holmes and 
Antti 2002; Keun, Ebbels et al. 2002; Beckonert, Bollard et al. 2003; Ebbels, Keun et 
al. 2003; Keun, Ebbels et al. 2003; Lenz, Bright et al. 2003; Wang, Bollard et al. 2003; 
Antti, Ebbels et al. 2004; Bugrim, Nikolskaya et al. 2004; Ebbels, Holmes et al. 2004; 
Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004; Kleno, Kiehr et al. 2004; Bollard, Keun et al. 2005; Dyrby, 
Baunsgaard et al. 2005; Smilde, Jansen et al. 2005; Hector C. Keun 2006; Timothy M. 
D. Ebbels 2006). While unsupervised methods such as PCA are useful for comparing 
normal and test samples, with large number of classes, supervised methods may be 
advantageous owing discrimination between classes. Partial least-squares (PLS), a 
supervised method, which by associating independent variables to dependent 
variables can reveal the influence of time or other external variables, particularly 
useful for analysis of samples taken over a period of time. Discriminant analysis is 
used to establish the optimal position to place a discriminant surface that best 
separates classes. SIMCA, a supervised method classifies data and models formed


## Page 10


1-10 
based on the training set. PCA is performed for each class (training set) and each 
sample in the test set is assigned into class model which can be best predicted. 
Therefore, SIMCA has the flexibility of not assigning samples into an inappropriate 
category if no class can be assigned. Similarly, following preliminary unsupervised 
analysis such as PCA, the supervised Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis 
(PLS-DA) can be conducted. The PLS associates a data matrix containing 
independent variables and samples to a matrix containing dependent variables (or 
measurements of response) and e.g. can be used for time series studies. The 
Discriminant analysis helps finding the position of a discriminant surface that best 
differentiates classes. In neural networks a training set of data is used to develop 
algorithms capable of coping with the structure and functional complexity of the data 
“learning”, operating at three or more layers i.e. input level of neurons (variables), 
one or more hidden layers of neurons, adjusting the weighting functions for each 
variable, and an output layer that designates the class of the object or sample. A 
probabilistic technique such as CLOUDS (Ebbels, Keun et al. 2003) (will be 
discussed later) has important advantages over methods such as k-nearest neighbour, 
linear discriminant analysis, because unlike these classifiers, the classification is not 
absolute and therefore, due to extra information (i.e. the class probabilities) there is 
more room for e.g. examining hypothesis and interpretation.  
 
1.3.1. CLOUDS-Overlap 
 
The standard or basic the CLOUDS model (Ebbels, Keun et al. 2003) is a supervised 
probabilistic approach and non-neural implementation of a classification technique, 
based on the Parzen density estimator (Parzen 1962). This which implemented into 
metabonomics initially using probabilistic neural networks (Holmes, Nicholson et al. 
2001; Dyrby, Baunsgaard et al. 2005; Smilde, Jansen et al. 2005; Timothy M. D. 
Ebbels 2006). When modelling complex multi-dimensional distributions, the 
CLOUDS gives a probabilistic rather than absolute class description of the data by 
summing Gaussian densities at each training set data point. The potentials such as 
choosing different smoothing parameters (σ) makes it is particularly amenable to 
inclusion of prior knowledge such as uncertainties in the data descriptors.  Also, 
unlike projection methods, it is relatively insensitive to outliers, yet readily detects

them as samples with consistently low membership probabilities across all classes 
(Ebbels, Keun et al. 2003). 
Since the classifications are not absolute, CLOUDS brings key improvements such as 
the uniqueness and confidence diagnostics.  
 
The probability of any data object with feature vector x belonging to class A is

where  is a parameter defining the smoothness of the probability estimate and xiA

In a nutshell based on the formulae, each data point from class A measures how far is 
from all data points of class B. Distances based on σ exponentially decreases 
probability of being in the same class. Sum of the probability give a estimate of 
overlapped probability of the two classes A and B. The similarity is between classes 
A and B is defined by normalising overlap integral (Equation 3), thus similarity 
measure ranges between 0 and 1, describing the situation when there is no overlap to 
the situation when two clouds are identical, respectively (Timothy M. D. Ebbels 
2006).

1.3.2. SMART scaling 
 
SMART analysis is a modelling strategy based on homothetic geometry (By 
translation and scaling without rotation, SMART analysis transforms data linearly and 
thus coinciding trajectories share homothetic geometry.), Together with PCA, 
SMART was applied to a number of toxicological studies including inter-laboratory 
variations in (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004) hydrazine response for visualizing similarity 
of multivariate responses. These in turn facilitate the interpretation of metabonomic 
data such as comparative study of endogenous metabolic response to toxins and could 
be implemented as a mechanism to classify unknown treatments based on responses 
known treatment (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). 
 
1.3.3. Commonly used terms in statistical pattern recognition 
1.3.3.1. 
Cross-validation  
Cross-validation is a method to estimate generalization error based on re-sampling i.e.  
the process of holding aside some training data which is not used to build a predictive 
model and to later use that data to estimate the accuracy of the model simulating the 
real world deployment of the model. In k-fold cross-validation, 
data is divided into k subsets of approximately equal size and then the model is trained 
k times, each time leaving out one of the subsets, which is used to compute the error.  
1.3.3.2. 
Classification vs. regression  
Classification and regression are standard statistical tools for reconstructing a source 
(or its attributes) from noise-corrupted data. Classification predicts categorical class 
labels (discrete or nominal), classifies data (constructs a model) based on the training 
set (The set of instances used for model construction) and the values (class labels) in a 
classifying attribute. The model can be presented as e.g. classification rules, decision 
trees, or mathematical formulae. Next, if the accuracy of the model is acceptable, the 
model can be used to classify future or unknown objects. The accuracy of the model 
can be estimated by comparing the known label of a test sample with the classified 
results from the model. The percentage of test set samples correctly classified by the 
model is called the accuracy rate. The test set must be independent of training set;


## Page 13


1-13 
otherwise the result is biased i.e. over-fitting occurs. Regression is a data analysis 
technique which is used to build predictive models for continuous prediction fields. It 
determines a mathematical equation that minimizes some measure of the error 
between the prediction from the regression model and the actual data. 
1.3.3.3. 
Supervised vs. unsupervised methods 
In unsupervised learning, or clustering, the goal of the analyses is to uncover trends, 
correlations, or patterns, and no assumptions are made about the structure of the data. 
In other words, a model is built without a well defined goal or prediction field. In 
supervised learning or class prediction, knowledge of a particular domain is used to 
help make distinctions of interest and e.g. involves learning a function y = f(x) from 
training examples of the form (x, f(x)). 
 
1.3.4. Pattern recognition techniques 
 
Like any other omics approaches such as genomics and proteomics, metabonomics 
also inevitably produces a massive information requiring extraction of an abstract, 
intelligible and most meaningful representation out of data to generate useful new 
knowledge with mechanistic and descriptive power(Goodacre, Vaidyanathan et al. 
2004). This will help also organise the experimental driven observations into a 
rational scheme. Pattern recognition techniques also might be used to determine the 
presence or the extent of any meaningful and significant difference between test and 
control models.  Principle component analysis (PCA) and PCA based models are the 
most commonly used pattern recognition techniques in metabonomic investigations.  
 
1.3.5. Principle component analysis (PCA)  
 
Pearson initially formulated PCA (Pearson 1901) and then Fisher and MacKenzie (R. 
Fisher 1923) outlined NIPALS algorithm, which later applied to chemometrics (Wold, 
Esbensen et al. 1987; Wichern 1992). PCA properly handles matrices with more 
variables than observations and potentially containing noisy and highly collinear data. 
This technique can be used for summarizing and data reduction, visualizing, 
preprossessing, classification and discriminant analysis, variable selection, predication, 
unmixing variables, and finding quantitative relationships among the variables (Wold,


## Page 14


1-14 
Esbensen et al. 1987; Eriksson, Antti et al. 2004). PCA estimates the correlation 
structure of the variables and in general any data matrix can be simplified by PCA, 
and e.g. it can be used to build a descriptive model of how a biochemical system 
behaves. PCA extracts the dominant object pattern and providing more 
comprehensible information as a new set of variable called scores, which are 
weighted sum of the original variables. The link between scores and original variables 
are the ‘loadings’ which define the weight or influence of the original variables on the 
pattern described by scores.  
 
The most common use of PCA is probably its ability to reduce the dimensionality (in 
multidimensional data matrices) of data into a simplified graphical plot(s) in a space 
defined by components.  
1.3.5.1. 
Some Important features of PCA: 
 
 Each component is a linear combination of original variables 
 Components are orthogonal and therefore each component describes the 
maximum variation not included in the previously calculated components 
 PCA plot captures and displays the most dominant patterns in the data matrix 
it is generally assumed that directions of maximum variance is the 
representation of maximum information 
 
1.4. 
Metabolic trajectories 
 
Although xenobiotic metabolism is the product of probability not design and therefore 
metabolic pathways should not be considered a sort of industrial production line, 
however, pathway undoubtedly can be considered as a valuable and useful 
diagrammatic summary (Wilson and Nicholson 2003). Analogously, an organism’s 
response to a stimulus, can be summarised using the metabolic trajectory (i.e. the path 
that it follows over time through an abstract metabolic space, obviously not signalling 
pathway).  “The term trajectory means a path, especially when parameterized by time, 
and the aims of metabonomic investigation could be interpreted as the attempt to 
define the metabolic trajectory resulting from a particular intervention: the coordinate 
system defines the set of metabolites that is measured, and the position on the path 
indicates the current abundance or flux of the species of interest” (Keun, Ebbels et al.


## Page 15


1-15 
2004). Varying metabolites along time, whether enriched or depleted, as well as 
dynamic covariations among them, which are of particular interest will determine the 
direction and distance travelled when the trajectory is visualised. Monitoring 
perturbations of metabolites (e.g. in serum or urine), induced in response to the 
natural cycle of a toxic process i.e. peak (maximum potential damage) and recovery 
(potential regeneration) reflects a pattern characteristic of a specific pathological 
process (e.g. mechanism of toxicity). This is influenced by various factors such as the 
nature of the toxic agents, dosage, body’s response and the extent and the number of 
organs involved as well as variations between individuals. 
 
Unavoidable variations arise during experiments (e.g. variations due to individual 
responses, unavoidable inter-laboratory differences, etc). Therefore, representation of 
an organism’s metabolic response to treatment using metabolic trajectories 
irrespective of baseline values and overall magnitude facilitates the incorporation and 
comparison of metabonomic data sets. This can improve the accuracy and precision of 
classification models (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004).

During experimental design there are different means and specific considerations and 
measures, which can be are taken to minimise and detect any systematic bias 
experimental errors during interpretation. It is not possible to create an ideal 
experiment, which can eliminate any intervening factor other than those of interest. 
Therefore, in many circumstances, especially for testing methodologies, it is very 
useful and logical step to simulate data and produce computationally simulated data to 
be able to take control of all variables and observe the exact effect of any particular 
factor on the performance of the model and the final results. Computer modelling can 
be used for hypothesis generation and prediction, system level insights.

Aims: 
 
As mentioned in earlier sections, the exact trajectories followed within a given 
treatment group differ due to variations between individuals. Although different

techniques such as SMART may at least partially balance the variations, more 
focused alignment techniques and protocols as well as novel bioinformatics tools 
which take into account the natural variations in speeds and magnitudes of responses 
between individuals are required so that characteristic or most probable trajectory of a 
treatment can be defined, which in turn can be used in interpretation and comparison 
toxicological responses in a wider range of metabonomic studies.  
 
By adoption of the two techniques (i.e. CLOUDS-Overlap and SMART) and a new 
approach based on the analysis of sum squared errors and testing the results on both 
experimental and computationally simulated data, this study aims at outlaying most 
accurate methodology and protocol for trajectory alignment with a view to defining 
the most probable trajectory of species- and treatment-specific biological response. 
 
 
Aims and objectives can be summarised as: 
 
1. Clearly defining trajectory alignment concept 
2. Developing reliable computational tools as well as mathematical 
methodologies for simulation of metabolic trajectories and modelling 
which can be used for testing trajectory alignment 
3. Developing alignment strategy based on the CLOUDS Overlap method 
4. Developing alignment strategy based on the standard error analysis 
5. Exploring potential capacities of standard methods such as PCA which 
are commonly applied in metabonomics 
6. Comparing pros and cons each technique especially from trajectory 
alignment perspective and possibly providing recommendations for 
applicability and suitability of each technique under different 
conditions and circumstances

2. Materials and Methods: 
 
Alignment in general can be defined as the process of adjusting parts so that they are 
in proper relative position. This can help examine if two or more shapes are similar if 
they are aligned properly. Similarly, ‘toxin likeness’ of one compound to another can 
be described by comparing the metabolic trajectories (connected the data across all 
time points) resulting from organisms’ response. In this study the trajectory alignment 
is referred as the process of extracting maximum similarity via calibrating the scale of 
trajectories. 
 
According to homothetic geometry hypothesis (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004), the shape 
of a ‘metabolic trajectory’ is indicative of the underlying biological cycle. 
Deformation of the shape or rotation of the trajectory is not allowed so that the 
integrity of the biological concept is maintained. Thus, alignment analysis of 
trajectories can rely merely on similarity measures of metabolic trajectories along a 
range of scales as well as linear translation of data points. Consequently, the best 
trajectory alignment will be expressed by relative scales of two (or more) trajectories 
when the maximum possible similarity occurs.  
 
Thus, in principle, trajectory alignment is indeed combination of translation and 
scaling optimisation scheme aimed at exploring maximum potential similarity among 
trajectories based on the assumption that maximum similarity is not a coincidental 
phenomenon, but indicative of a unique mechanism with diverged manifestations in 
form of metabolic trajectories owing to a number of factors such as biological time 
differences between organisms. This conjecture also has been examined by cross 
validating (correlating) the similarity measures of metabolic trajectories obtained 
from NMR spectroscopy of urine samples of the mice with the severity of histo-
pathological damages in liver samples taken from the same mice euthanized after the 
urine samples had been taken (Hector C. Keun 2006). 
 
In this section, the overall structure of the methodology is outlined and more detailed 
explanations are provided under the relevant subheadings.

Conceptually, alignment of metabolic trajectories in this study is comprised of two 
major components:  
 
1. Similarity measures 
2. Acceptable transformations 
 
Similarity measures between trajectories were detailed by employing two following 
techniques: 
 
a. The extended version of the CLOUDS (Ebbels, Keun et al. 2003), so called 
the Overlap technique (Timothy M. D. Ebbels 2006) 
b. A new method based on Sum of squared Error Analysis (SEA) 
 
Methodologically, similarity analysis was formed based on two major approaches: 
 
1. Local approach: In this approach, in calculation of similarities, not all of data 
points belonging to each trajectory are necessarily taken into account.  
2. Global approach: This approach, which employs the CLOUDS and the Global 
SEA technique, takes account of all data points belonging to all trajectories 
during similarity calculation between two (single or group of) trajectories  
 
Figure 3 Schematically presents the entire trajectory alignment process in this study. 
SMART can be considered as scaling scheme.

Figure 3 Overview of metabolic trajectories alignment 
 
For alignment purposes, a SMART- (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004) based method has 
been employed. Standard SMART technique is ‘rigid’ in that sense that it scales 
trajectories into their maximum dimension only. Since metabolic response 
irrespective of baseline values and overall magnitude, defines the mode of response of 
the organism to treatment (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004), SMART pre-treatments or linear 
scaling does not affect the results according to homothetic geometry. In this study 
SMART is applied on each (single of group of) trajectory initially to ‘normalise’ them 
so that trajectories become more comparable to each other. Various scales are applied 
to ‘normalised’ trajectories and each time similarity between trajectories is measured. 
Therefore, this is a SMART based approach which allows various scales to be used 
and therefore can be considered ‘flexible’ compared to standard SMART. For this 
reason and for simplicity this method will be referred as F-SMART (i.e. Flexible 
SMART). Two differences between F-SMART and SMART are: 
 
 Additional scaling step following standard SMART  
 Translation of trajectories into their median instead of one time point (usually 
first or second) which is done in standard SMART

Modelled trajectories were created using computationally generated data. During 
entire analysis, (MathWorks Inc.Version 7.0.0.19920 R14) was used for programming, 
data handling, statistical analysis, developing and testing computational models as 
well as data simulations. 
 
2.1. 
PCA 
 
PCA was carried out to reduce dimensionality of both the NMR and a simulated data, 
using a MatLab subroutine, which was developed based on the NIPALS algorithm (R. 
Fisher 1923; Erriksson 2001) To examine the subroutine’s performance, a 100 × 240 
matrix (100 dimensions and 240 variables) was generated, using random normal 
variates. Subsequently, coordinates along 4th, 10th, and 36th dimensions were 
multiplied by 5, 10, and 20 respectively. Dimensions and scale factors were chosen 
arbitrarily. Scores, residuals, and loadings of the data matrix computed using the 
developed PCA subroutine (first 4 principle components). The original coordinates as 
well as the residuals of the same dimensions (i.e. 4th, 10th, and 36th) were visualised 
using black, blue, green, and red colours respectively to create 3D image See Figure 4.  
 
Loadings of PC 1 to 4 also were visualised using the same colour scheme 
corresponding to the residuals of components (i.e. blue, green, red) for loadings of PC 
1 to 3 respectively and brown for loadings of PC 4. According to the loadings shown 
in Figure 4, as expected, the first component (PC1) is mainly influenced by 36th 
dimension (the biggest variation i.e. multiplied by 20), PC 2 by 10th (multiplied by 10) 
and PC 3 by 4th dimension. PC 4 Loadings is not pronounced at towards any 
particular dimension. These features explain that PCA code is working.  
 
Since loadings are normalised, therefore existence of one extreme value automatically 
compresses the other peaks. As shown in the Figure 4, loadings of first 3 PCs 
describing 3 outliers, contain one prominent peak on almost a straight line (other 
peaks are shortened), whereas loadings of 4th PC show very noisy pattern and there is 
not a prominent peak. Because loadings reflect the influence of the original variables 
on scores, therefore it can be intriguing idea to use loadings plot to determine the 
number of components, which sufficiently explain a data set. One example of the


## Page 21


2-21 
standard methods is ‘scree graph’, which can be used to determine rank of the PCA 
model of a matrix (Jolliffe, Uddin et al. 2002). Figure 4 extracted from a published 
paper (Jansen, Hoefsloot et al. 2004) is displayed as an example for use of ‘scree 
graph’ to determine the number of principle component in which principle 
components and Eigenvalues were plotted on x and y axes respectively. For instance 
authors in this study have chosen 3 principle component explaining explains 66% of 
the variation in the data (Jansen, Hoefsloot et al. 2004)

2.2. 
Data simulation: 
 
 
Metabolic trajectory is categorized as time-series analysis i.e. there is an ordered 
sequence of values of variables derived from samples taken at equally spaced time 
intervals. To model a metabolic trajectory, identification of the underlying forces and 
structure that produce the observed data is essential. 
 
2.2.1. Metabolite concentration function 
 
The concentration of a metabolite (serum or urine) which is affected during biological 
response to a xenobiotic agent follows a path, which is typically an asymmetric (a 
positive skew or skewed to the right) curve beginning with a sharp rise up to a peak 
(e.g. damage due to toxicant) and then relatively smooth decline to the original level 
(recovery or regeneration).  This curve with a long tail in the positive direction can be 
graphically visualised using coordinate systems in a way that for instance time and the


## Page 23


2-23 
metabolite concentration are represented by X and Y axes. Figure 2 A illustrates a 
modelled curve analogous to biological response.   
 
The following formula (coined as Metabolite Concentration Function, MCF) can be 
used to simulate the positive skew curve, an analogous to the natural cycle of the 
biological response:

 in such a way as if they were taken exactly at similar distances of

Figure 6: Simulation of biological time difference 
 
During the analysis of metabonomic data, each measured metabolite (or chemical 
shift) is considered as one variable. Typically, there are always a number of sets of 
covarying variables, which are detected by pattern recognition techniques such as 
PCA. For this reason, during modelling of each animal, 10 different positive skew 
curves were created. To generate each curve, each time random normal variates were 
assigned to, , m . In modelling, three variables coined A_Range, B_Range, and


## Page 26


2-26 
M_Range were considered to define the ranges of random normal variates, ,m , 
respectively. 
 
For t a range of 10 values in an increasing order with equal interval were used to 
simulate 10 samples taken from every animal at 10 different time points, except the 
times when generating different speeds were intended and then intervals were not 
equal.  Subsequently, each modelled metabolite signal was replicated 10 times with 
slight variations within a defined range of variance so that ultimately 10 sets of 
dimensions, each set containing 10 covarying dimensions with equal variances were 
created. Since during modelling each curve (simulating biological response),
)
(tf
 was 
calculated at 10 differentt values, therefore, every modelled animal was defined by a 
10 × 100 matrix (10 rows for time points and 100 columns for dimensions or 
modelled metabolites). As mentioned earlier, 100 dimensions structurally could be 
divided into 10 sets, each set containing10 strongly covarying metabolites.  
 
The following formula explains how simulated concentration levels of a metabolite 
along time using MCF are replicated to generate a set of relatively similar values 
within a defined variance:

Figure 7: Simulation of biological noise 
 
With regard to the simulation of noise or ‘Deviation’ variable, depending on the 
biological question, there is a useful practical point to be aware of. During the 
analysis, if modelled trajectories are going to be scaled or normalised and compared, 
probably it is a good practise to set the level of noise ‘Deviation’ proportionate to the 
magnitude of the original modelled curves. This matter will be mentioned later when 
application of SMART technique(Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004) is being discussed.  
 
To generate a similar animal model but with small normal variation, the following

variable, using random normal variate with multiplicative effect on all variation of a 
group of modelled animals.

Trajectory Similarity Metrics: 
 
2.3.1. CLOUDS – Overlap: 
 
The CLOUDS Overlap (Timothy M. D. Ebbels 2006) (detailed in the introduction) 
was used as a tool to measure similarity between trajectories.  
 
 
2.3.1.1. 
Smoothing factor (σ) optimisation 
 
Initially maximum likelihood, using cross-validation (See introduction) implemented 
in the accompanied programme for the Overlap was tested. Figure 8 shows the plot in 
the optimised σ is 1.2250 based on all the experimental data used in this study. Then, 
because the exact value of σ is not critical, after preliminary investigations on both 
experimental and simulation data, σ=1 was found generally suitable and used as 
default throughout the study, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Secondary peaks in similarity plot 
 
Probably one of the pitfalls of the trajectory alignment via local approach in general 
and overlap technique in particular is when data points approach each other as the 
whole shapes expands due to scaling. The best example of this situation can be shown 
in grid data points where data points are lined up in similar directions yielding high 
similarity measures during scaling and consequently e.g. a number of secondary peaks 
appear if the similarity is plotted against scale factor using CLOUDS-Overlap. Figure 
9 illustrates the same effect and also showing how different σ values can affect 
similarity measures.

2.3.2. Squared Errors Analysis (SEA): 
 
Probably this is the first time that squared errors analysis is introduced to 
metabonomics. Squared errors analysis is introduced as implementation standard sum 
squared sum errors SSE which coined as SEA-local, Goodness of fit for two 
trajectories (local and regional), and SEA-Global and each of the might address 
biological questions from different perspectives: 
 
2.4. 
Trajectory Similarity Metrics via Local Approach: 
 
Principally, this approach has been considered assuming it will be able to cope with 
some specific problems rising during interpretation of metabolic trajectories. 
‘Biological time’ difference is a major factor which can affect interpretation of 
metabolic state if it is not properly handled by the employed methods. There are also 
other common practical issues making interpretation of the trajectories more difficult 
such as missing data and inter-laboratory mismatch in number of time points when 
biological samples are taken.


## Page 31


2-31 
What characteristically differentiates local approach in trajectory similarity metrics 
from global is that in local approach not all data points of trajectories, which are 
subject to similarity analysis are necessarily taken into account for actual similarity 
calculations. In other words, out of each trajectory, only a group of selected data 
points geometrically confined to some mathematical boundaries are considered for 
similarity measurement. The ways these boundaries are drawn and also the ways 
similarity calculations are made vary depending on the chosen technique. Techniques, 
which can be used to measure similarity via local approach, are: 
 
1. SEA-Local 
2. Goodness of fit for two individual trajectories - Local 
3. Goodness of fit for two individual trajectories – Regional 
 
In principle it is possible to use these elements (defining boundaries and mathematical 
calculation) interchangeably (i.e. defining mathematical boundaries based on one 
method and calculating similarity using the other method) which can probably 
provide further alternatives for similarity-metrics. 
 
2.4.1. SEA Local: 
 
Like any other time series analyses, study of metabolic trajectory accounts for the 
assumption that data points, taken over equally spaced time intervals may have an 
internal structure (such as autocorrelation, trend). Thus sum of the squared errors 
between two groups of trajectories, A and B, can address the question whether or not 
and to what extents they are equal. In this approach one group of trajectories (e.g. A) 
is used as reference trajectory group, from which expected values can be elucidated, 
whereas the other one (e.g. B) is used as test or observed trajectory group. 
 
Data points in reference trajectory group are clustered (using Kmeans algorythm) and 
subsequently the resultant centroids are used to classify the data points of test 
trajectory group. Any given data point in test group is classified to class i if it has the 
shortest distance to centroidi compared to the other centroids. During clustering, to


## Page 32


2-32 
increase the efficiency of the programme, medians of the time points of the reference 
trajectories were used as seeds for clustering. 
A centroid, without any associated coordinate from test trajectories
A centroid, with one or more associated coordinate from test trajectories
A coordinate from reference trajectories
A coordinate test trajectories
A cluster with no classified coordinate from test trajectories
A cluster with at least one classified coordinate from test trajectories
Connector of reference coordinates (reference trajectory)
Connector of test coordinates (test trajectory)
 
Figure 10: Schematic illustration of trajectories from reference and test trajectories and clusters 
and classes  
  
Figure 10 schematically illustrates 3 trajectories of hypothetical reference (observed) 
and 3 of test data coordinates. Coordinates of reference trajectories develop 8 clusters 
and naturally there are 8 centroids, of which only 4 cetroids are accounted for 
calculation because each of these four cetroids (shown in red 8-points star) form a 
class containing at least 1 coordinate from test trajectories (circled by red dashed 
lines). Each coordinate form test trajectory is classified into the nearest centroid from 
reference trajectory clusters. 
 
To calculate SEA local, first within scope of each class, sum of the squared distances 
of test trajectory coordinates from the associated centroid is calculated and divided by

Calculating this way, sum of the values derived from all classes is considered as SEA

2.4.3. Goodness of Fit for two Trajectories (GFT) Regional: 
 
GFT-Regional is an extended version of GFT-Local which performs in both 
directions and measures a wider domain of data point (i.e. the boundaries around the 
classes are likely to expand, the reason why ‘regional’ name is chosen in contrast to 
‘local’).  
 
For instance if A and B are two trajectories, first data points A are classified to B data 
points (Error! Reference source not found. on the top, where schematically classes 
circled by red dashed lines). Next, data points B are classified to data points A (Error! 
Reference source not found. in the middle classes circled by blue dashed lines).  
 
As per Error! Reference source not found., GFT-Regional is measured by summing 
the squared distances between data points A and data points B only within merged 
classes (Error! Reference source not found. in the middle merged classes circled by

1. CLOUDS-Overlap (Described earlier) 
2. SEA Global 
 
2.5.1. SEA Global: 
 
In this technique, the squared sum of the all distances between data points of two 
(individual or groups of) trajectories are calculated. To do this, trajectories should be 
(at least partially) superimposed by translating them to one of their time points or 
preferably to their medians or means. A trajectory can be conceived as a polygonal 
shape and thus it can be assumed that the sum of the squared distances between 
intersections of shape A and shape B is measured (e.g. in case of two individual 
trajectories). When calculating the distances in this way, there are some distances 
which cannot be considered as ‘errors’, which somehow must be eliminated from the 
sum of the errors. These ‘non-error’ distances (NERD) are generated if the line 
connecting an intersection from shape (trajectory) A to an intersection from shape B 
crosses over the area which both shapes overlap. This effect can be coined as 
‘diagonal effect’ because the NERDs are similar to diagonals of a shape. Figure 11 
schematically illustrates two ideal trajectories in form of two polygons and the 
connections between the intersections of the two superimposed shapes. The NERDs 
and ‘diagonal effect’ are shown with semi-transparent light brown and the ‘error 
distances’ with light green colours. The proposed Equation 10 sums the squared error 
distances after removing the estimated squared distances of NERDs.

2.6. 
Trajectory Alignment  
 
A trajectory and translated and/or expanded or contracted versions of it (homothetic 
trajectories(Weisstein; Borowski 1989)) share many important features such as the 
correlations in relative size and direction of metabolite, yet they disregard the initial 
metabolic and the overall magnitude of a treatment-related effect as well as the exact 
time of events for interpretation (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Because a rotated 
trajectory no longer represents important aspects such as direction of the metabolite 
within metabolic space, so far, rotation has not been generally accepted in 
metabonomic analysis. 
2.6.1. Translation 
 
In metabonomics, trajectories are allowed to be translated because, in many 
circumstances, the comparison of initial metabolic states and the exact time of events 
are not of major concern. 
 
Methodologically, trajectories can be translated to: 
 
1. a specific single time point - peripheral translation (PTN) 
2. the median/mean - central translation (CTN) 
 
The position of the homothetic centre (HC) of a trajectory moves towards the time 
point chosen for translation during the PTN, whereas during the CTN, HC moves to 
the centre.  HC (shown in Figure 12) is the focal point where the connectors of 
corresponding points from homothetic figures meet. Each connector is divided in the 
same ratio at this point (Weisstein; Johnson 1929).

2-40 
is the homothetic centre of the homothetic figures              and 
 
Figure 12: Homothetic Centre (Extracted from a web resource (Weisstein)) 
 
Whether biological interpretations can directly be influenced by HC position, might 
require further and specific investigations beyond the scope of this report, however, 
they are likely to be affected indirectly at least, owing to effect of the HC on 
similarity measures especially when similarities of two or more trajectories are 
calculated along a range of scales. Quite often, different trajectories have different 
directions and if the HC is not centrally positioned, during scaling of trajectories, the 
data points are likely to be engaged less effectively and at least biased towards the 
partial overlapping areas. When there is only a partial overlap of trajectories, model 
scores and residuals are more reliable parameters to compare (Keun, Ebbels et al. 
2004). although, loadings can provide a scale-free and baseline independent means 
(Benigni and Giuliani 1994). Comparison between peripheral and central translations 
is illustrated in Figure 13. The ‘partial overlap’ is clearly visible in the figure. 
Peripheral translation has been applied in metabonomics for alignment purpose in 
SMART method, which aimed at removing predose differences as major magnitude 
differences in the data (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). It should be taken into account 
before choosing the translation method depending on the objectives of the study that 
probably the central translation does not specifically eliminate predose differences

2.6.2. Scaling 
 
In addition to translation, trajectory alignment can be further calibrated through scalar 
dilation or contraction, disregarding the overall magnitude of response.  
 
2.6.2.1. 
SMART analysis 
 
SMART analysis can be considered a specific form of alignment, which originally 
was designed to accurately test for coincident geometry (homothety) of trajectories 
using PCA. The average spectrum from the 0 h measurement for each study was 
subtracted from all of the spectra for each study and all time points are divided by the 
distance of the furthest time point from 0 measurement, assuming that the largest 
distances provide an estimation of the overall magnitude of the treatment-related 
response (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004).  
 
 
2.6.2.2. 
‘Smart’ SMART


## Page 42


2-42 
One advantage of SMART can be described as its ability to ‘normalise’ trajectories i.e. 
trajectories are scaled to unite, which facilitates the comparison of different 
trajectories using various scales. Another words, if two trajectories A and B are 
homothetic and for instance A is scaled to a range of ordered values, it is expected 
that the maximum similarity be seen when A is scaled to 1 if both A and B had 
already scaled to maximum before test scaling. Otherwise, the maximum similarity 
would be at the inverse scale of A to B. Then it would be difficult e.g. to see whether 
the maximum similarity was the result of homothetic geometry or only a coincident. 
 
2.6.3. PCA and Scaling Integration 
 
PCA is very commonly used to summarise complex multidimensional data sets which 
are often seen during metabonomic studies. Consistent differences in the average 
position or size of distribution between two clusters within the data will bias PCA to 
describe these differences at the cost of accurately modelling the treatment-related 
effects (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). To investigate how SMART affect homothetic 
trajectories, first, two curves (signals) with two different magnitudes were generated 
using Equation 4. Next, two additional curves were generated by multiplying the 
original curves by 2. Therefore, the trajectory of the second set of curves had twice 
magnitude of the trajectory of the original set. Then, a number of realisations were 
added to the data points of the smaller and the larger trajectories shown in Figure 14 
A and B, respectively, using Equation 5. Subsequently, mean trajectories of the two 
data sets (the larger and the smaller) were calculated (Figure 14, E and F respectively). 
The first time point of each of these  two mean trajectories as well as the original 
trajectory (without realisations and enlargement) were subtracted from the rest of their 
time points (translated to the first time point) and then they were scaled to maximum 
(Figure 14, G).

2.6.4. Homothetic geometry & metabolite speed 
 
Figure 16 A, B, C, and D, schematically illustrate trajectory generation from 
simulation of metabolic path, sampled signals in time series, and trajectories before 
and after SMART scaling, respectively. Modelled trajectories only differ in their 
initial speed and although the original dimensions follow exactly the identical path 
(Green line in A), the generated trajectories are similar (Weisstein; Johnson 1929) and 
do not have parallel sides (similitude center instead of homothetic centre) as shown in 
Figure 16 C and D. Thus, the time gap alone can lead to bifurcation of trajectories. 
SMART scaling does not rectify the problem. This is conceptually associated to the 
translation models presented earlier.

Simulation 
 
Using developed programmes, a number of sets of data were generated so as to test 
the potential effects of different factors including the level of noise, variations 
between animals, and variations between groups of test and reference animals 
(assuming they are from different species). In the following examples, data initially 
generated at 210 dimensions, of which each set of 7 dimensions were highly 
correlated (generated using Equation 5 (
7

i
) for 30 original dimensions generated 
using Equation 4) such a way that when the level of noise is set to zero, those groups 
of 7 dimensions correlated 100% and the more the level of noise increases, the 
correlation coefficient among them declines. Structurally, data was divided into two 
groups (i.e. Test and Ref) which were identical unless the ‘variation between groups’ 
is set above zero. Next, PCA was performed on the generated data with two principle 
components. Subsequently, the data set (modelling test group) multiplied to an 
ordered range of scalars and each time the similarity was measured using CLOUDS-
Overlap, SEA-Local, and SEA-Global. Figure 13-19 plot the influence of level of 
noise, variations between animals, variations between Ref and Test groups, and initial 
speed differences on similarity measures. The relative values of these factors 
displayed on the figures. In each figure, a and b illustrate translations to the first time 
point and to median respectively. Test trajectories are shown in blue colour and Ref 
trajectories in red. C, d, and e depict plots of similarity measures calculated based on 
CLOUDS-Overlap, SEA-Local, and SEA-Global respectively against the ranges of 
scales of homothetic figures of test trajectories. When, variations are close to zero, 
desirable results for CLOUDS and SEA (Local/Global) are 1 and 0 respectively.

Experimental (biological) data: 
 
Urine samples NMR collected from 5 experiments studying metabolic response of 
hydrazine carried out by 5 participating companies participating in the COMET 
project, (Lindon, Keun et al. 2005) were included in analysis. The studies labelled as 
L01, N01, R01, R02, S01, and R12. For each experiment, 20 rats were randomly 
chosen and divided into control and dosed groups and their urine samples were 
collected at 10 time points during 8 days. Two samples were taken before 
administrating of Hydrazine. Half of the animals receiving hydrazine were euthanized 
at 48h post-dose and the other half euthanized at 168h post-dose for histopathological 
and clinical chemistry evaluation.  
 
1H NMR spectra were measured at 600 MHz and 300K using a robotic flow-injection 
system (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). Signals in regions of equal width (0.04 
ppm) in the chemical shift ranges 0.20-4.50ppm and 5.98-10.0ppm were integrated 
and spectral artefacts in the region 4.50-5.98ppm were excluded and finally after 
replacing non-endogenous signals related to drug related compounds (Ebbels 2002)

(thus resulting analysis is focused on reliably profiling metabolic change within the 
living system), each NMR spectrum was reduced into 190 variables. All reduced 
spectra were then normalized to a constant integrated intensity of 100 units to take 
account of large variations in urine concentration. PCA carried out on all data at

3. Results & Discussion: 
 
A pervasive theme in metabolic trajectory analysis is judging when two or more 
responses are the same as it has been hypothesized that the geometry of the metabolic 
trajectories is characteristic of the biological response (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Yet, 
due to unavoidable inter-individual variations, the exact trajectories characterising the 
biological responses differ. Therefore, it is intriguing to examine whether the minor 
differences seen between metabolic trajectories of a specific treatment, correspond to 
the variations seen in other biological manifestations of the same treatment. 
Differences in trajectories can be measured via alignment procedures introduced and 
implemented in this study.  
 
Trajectory alignment yields 2 numbers which can be termed as ‘best scale’ and 
‘maximum similarity measure’. Scales and measures were obtained after PCA using 2 
and 5 PCs. The hypothesis that relative scales and/or similarity of a metabolic 
trajectories are indicative of variations in underlying biological response, the best 
scales and the maximum similarity measures from the CLOUDS and the SEAGlobal as 
well as largest magnitudes from SMART method were compared with the severities 
of the two types histopathological lesions (i.e. lipidosis and glycogen deposition) in 
hepatic cells observed 48 and 168 hours after administration of Hydrazine to the 
experimental rats in high dose group. Significant correlation was observed between 
the severity of lipidosis and glycogen lesions at 48 hours and scales in both 2PCs and 
5PCs analysis. Severity of lesion was rated using the following scale: 0 – not 
observable; 1 – minimal; 2 – mild; 3 – moderate; 4 – marked; 5 - severe. The 
SEAGlobal values (SSE) showed significant correlation with glycogen deposition at the 
same hour. No significant correlation was observed with the rest of variables. Table 1 
summarises the results of the correlation analysis. Table 1  presents correlation matrix 
between histopathological lesions only for comparison purpose, which shows 
significant correlation between the two types of lesions at 48 hours. Figure 24, Figure 
25, Figure 26, and Figure 27 respectively scatter plot the 3 three observed significant 
observations as well as scatter plot of the CLOUDS similarities and the glycogen 
deposition at 48 hours (in which a significant correlation exists between scales 
derived from the CLOUDS method the lesion). All figures contain only 5 points. In

Figure 24, Figure 25, and Figure 26, floor effect is visible because in glycogen 
deposition data the real difference is between R01/R02 and the rest of values gives 
correlation. Figure 27 related to lipidosis demonstrate an obvious correlation between 
the severity of the lesions and the scales of the trajectories obtained via the CLOUDS 
method..

Homothetic geometry & SMART & PCA 
 
Although conceptually the drawing conclusion  is true that in principal homothetic 
geometry is independent of sampling and principle and in principle homothetic 
similar trajectories,  
 
In principle, rotationally transformed similar trajectories would not share the same 
directions of metabolite changes and thus would not be expected to reflect similar 
system behaviour (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004) and also homothetic geometry is 
independent of sampling. However, during interpretation of metabolic trajectory, it is 
important to bear in mind that in ‘real world application’, unavoidable onset/speed 
variations in biological responses from of an identical system behaviour together with 
sampling effects are added complexity which can make the trajectories appear non-
homothetic as shown in Figure 28 and Figure 29 two trajectories of identical system 
behaviour with mild and extreme divergences respectively. The largest magnitude of 
identical response can be significantly distorted i.e. they are 2.61 and 2.18 for the 
Figure 28 and 1.35 and 0.36 for Figure 29  in the respectively.  This means the largest 
magnitude of in one of the slower model has shown 1.1972 and 3.7500 times (almost 
4 fold increase) bigger whereas when the SMART method is used  to measure 
similarities between trajectories it would have been expected they show almost 
identical magnitudes.

In conclusion; the results reinforce the hypothesis that differences between metabolic 
trajectories rises from inter-individual variations in biological responses to a specific 
treatment which to reasonable extents can be eliminated by alignment procedure 
presented in this study especially the CLOUDS method. Aligned trajectories, 
characteristic of a specific treatment, then can be used for comparison with other 
treatment specific or unknown trajectories, which can have many metabonomic 
applications such as preclinical toxicological screening. These results further confirm 
that concept of ‘likeness’ in metabonomic trajectories is biologically relevant.
