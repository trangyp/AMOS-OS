Abstract
Everyday we are exposed to various chemicals
via food additives, cleaning and cosmetic prod-
ucts and medicines — and some of them might be
toxic. However testing the toxicity of all existing
compounds by biological experiments is neither
ﬁnancially nor logistically feasible.
Therefore
the government agencies NIH, EPA and FDA
launched the Tox21 Data Challenge within the
“Toxicology in the 21st Century” (Tox21) initia-
tive. The goal of this challenge was to assess
the performance of computational methods in
predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds.
State of the art toxicity prediction methods build
upon speciﬁcally-designed chemical descriptors
developed over decades. Though Deep Learning
is new to the ﬁeld and was never applied to tox-
icity prediction before, it clearly outperformed
all other participating methods. In this applica-
tion paper we show that deep nets automatically
learn features resembling well-established toxi-
cophores. In total, our Deep Learning approach
won both of the panel-challenges (nuclear recep-
tors and stress response) as well as the overall
Grand Challenge, and thereby sets a new stan-
dard in tox prediction.
1. Introduction
Throughout their lives people are exposed to a sheer end-
less variety of chemical compounds, many of which are po-
tentially dangerous. Determining the toxicity of a chemical
is of crucial importance in order to minimize our exposure
to harmful substances in every day products. Toxicity is
also a central issue in the development of new drugs, with
more than 30 % of drug candidates failing in clinical trials
because of undetected toxic effects (Kola & Landis, 2004;
Arrowsmith, 2011).
In 2008, the U. S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)
and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
agreed on collaborating on future toxicity testing activ-
ities (Committee on Toxicity Testing and Assessment of
Environmental Agents, National Research Council, 2007).
Their efforts were later joined by the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) under the umbrella of the Tox21
Program. The program’s stated goals are to develop bet-
ter toxicity assessment methods, as current methods are not
likely to scale with the increased demand for effective tox-
icity testing.
Current methods for testing the toxicity of a high number of
chemicals rely on High-Throughput Screening (HTS). HTS
experiments can investigate whether a chemical compound
at a given concentration exhibits a certain type of toxicity,
for a number of different compounds in parallel. These
experiments are repeated with varying concentrations of
the chemical compound, which allows to determine dose-
response curves (Inglese et al., 2006). From these curves
one can reliably determine whether a compound activated
a given pathway or receptor, inhibited it or did not interact
at all.
Conducting these HTS experiments is a time- and cost-
intensive process. Typically, a compound has to be tested
for several types of toxicity at different concentration lev-
els. Thus, the whole procedure has to be rerun for many
times for each compound. Usually, a cell line has to be
cultivated to obtain a single data point. Even an unprece-
dented multi-million-dollar effort, the Tox21 project, could
test only a few thousands of compounds for as few as
twelve toxic effects.
Therefore, accurate computational
methods for accurate prediction of toxic effects are highly
demanded.

Toxicity Prediction using Deep Learning
Existing computational approaches can be grouped into
structure- and ligand-based. The structure-based methods
simulate physical interactions between the compound and
a biomolecular target (Kitchen et al., 2004) but are only
applicable if the complete 3D structure of all interacting
molecules are known, and they are infeasible for larger
compound data bases.
Ligand-based approaches predict
the interactions based on previous measurements (Jenkins
et al., 2007). Previous machine learning efforts were al-
most always ligand-based, such as scoring approaches like
the Naive Bayes statistics (Xia et al., 2004; Nigsch et al.,
2008; Mussa et al., 2013), density estimation (R. et al.,
2012; Harper et al., 2001), nearest neighbor, support vec-
tor machines, and shallow feed forward neural networks
(Byvatov et al., 2003; Lowe et al., 2011).
In 2012, the Merck Kaggle challenge on chemical com-
pound activity was won using deep neural networks, and
the winning group later showed that multi-task learning can
help to predict biological activities on single proteins (Dahl
et al., 2014). Dahl’s success inspired us to use Deep Learn-
ing for toxicity and target prediction (Unterthiner et al.,
2014). In contrast to biological activities of proteins, tox-
icological effects involve whole cell states determined by
dysregulated biological processes. More speciﬁcally, tox-
icity prediction mainly focuses on cellular assays which
measure cytotoxicity, i.e., they measure if a compound is
toxic to a cell. A (cyto)toxic compound will cause harm to
a cell, e.g. by causing acute mechanical injury or by trig-
gering the programmed cell death mechanism (apoptosis)
in the affected cells, which multicellular organisms use to
protect themselves from cells that have gone out of control.
1.1. Deep Learning for Toxicity Prediction
Deep learning architectures seem to be well suited for tox-
icity prediction because they (1) automatically construct
complex features (Bengio et al., 2013) and (2) allow for
multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Deng et al., 2013; Ben-
gio et al., 2013).
One key aspect of toxicological research is its reliance
on hierarchical levels of abstraction when thinking about
chemical structures. A major research goal is the iden-
tiﬁcation of toxicophores, (Kier, 1971; Lin, 2000) which
are the sets of steric and electronic properties that together
produce a certain toxicological effect. These properties in-
clude hydrophobic regions, aromatic rings, electron accep-
tors or donors.
This maps naturally to Deep Learning architectures, where
higher levels represent more complex concepts (Bengio,
2013). This idea is depicted in Figure 1, where ECFP4 in-
put data (chemical substructures) represent low level prop-
erties in their ﬁrst layer, which are combined to form reac-
tive centers, which in turn encode toxicophores in higher
layers.
Additionally, Deep Learning is ideally suited for multi-task
learning, which is a common setting for toxicology pre-
diction: The same compound is often under investigation
for several types of toxicity, and each of these types is its
own prediction task. The work of (Ramsundar et al., 2015)
also shows that the multi-task environment does help when
predicing chemical compounds, and that the performance
boost obtained this way increases with the number of ad-
ditional learning tasks. However, we typically have to deal
with missing labels, as not all compounds will have been
tested for each type of toxicity, or because some measure-
ments were inconclusive.
Integrating all prediction tasks into one overarching multi-
task setting offers two advantages: (a) it naturally allows
for multi-label information and therefore can utilize rela-
tions between tasks; (b) it allows to share hidden unit rep-
resentations among prediction tasks. The latter item is par-
ticularly important in our application as for some tasks very
few measurements are available, therefore single-task pre-
diction may fail to construct an effective representation.
Thus, deep networks exploit representations learned across
different tasks and can boost the performance on tasks with
few training examples. Furthermore, this method allows
us to predict an arbitrary number of toxicological effects at
the same time, without the need to train single classiﬁers
for each one.
2. Methods
2.1. DNN Architecture
Our system takes a numerical descriptor of a given com-
pound as input, and tries to predict several different types
of toxic effects at the same time. Such a type could be
e.g. whether the compound acts as inhibitor to a speciﬁc
nuclear receptor, or whether it activates a speciﬁc stress re-
sponse pathway. Each of these types is a binary prediction
task.
Formally, the problem we are trying to solve presents itself
as follows: given a chemical compound i, we want to pre-
dict whether the compound has property t. We encode this
information in the binary value yit, where yit = 1 if the
compound has the property and yit = 0 otherwise. We are
interested in predicting the behavior of a compound on T
properties at the same time.
Each compound is represented using a number of numer-
ical (or binary) features described later in this section.
As training data, we are given a numerical representation
xi ∈Rd of n training compounds as well as a sparsely
populated matrix Y ∈Rn·m of measurements.
We solve this by using a training objective that is the

weighted sum of the cross-entropies over all tasks t:
−
T
X
t
mti (yit log (σt(xi)) + (1 −yit) log (1 −σt(xi)))
The binary variable mti is 1 if sample i has a valid label
for task t and 0 otherwise. Each single training sample
contributed only to a few of the tasks. Thus, output units
that were not active during a training sample were masked
during backpropagation by multiplying their δ error by mti.
Our network consists of one or multiple layers of ReLU
hidden units (Nair & Hinton, 2010; Glorot et al., 2011), fol-
lowed by one layer of one or more sigmoid output units,
one for each classiﬁcation task.
2.2. Hyperparameters
The input features had substantially different scales and
distributions, such that it was not obvious how to best pre-
process them. We tried both the standard deviation as well
as simple tanh nonlinearity to bring the chemical descrip-
tors in the same range. ECFP4 features were either scaled
by tanh or sqrt nonlinearities. We additionally used a sim-
ple thresholding scheme to ﬁlter out very sparse features,
which helped to bring the number of features down into a
manageable range.
We tried different combinations of the available features,
e.g. using only the binary ECFP4 ﬁngerprints, or combin-
ing only the chemical descriptors with the toxicophore fea-
tures.
To regularize our network, we used both Dropout (Hinton
et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014) as well as small
amounts of L2 weight decay, which both work in concert to
avoid regularization (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Dahl et al.,
2014). Additionally, we used Early Stopping as determined
via cross-validation.
Table 1 contains the complete list of hyperparameters we
used for our network, as well as the search range for each
parameter.
2.3. Input Features
Having good input features is a crucial issue for chemoin-
formatics applications. A vast variety of different methods
exist, which calculate numerical features of the the typical
graph-based storage format used for chemical compounds.
We used a high-dimensional binary representation using
Extended Connectivity FingerPrint (ECFP4) features, the
currently best performing compound description in drug
design applications (Rogers & Hahn, 2010).
Each fea-
ture/ﬁngerprint denotes the presence-count of a certain
chemical substructure, such as the ones given on the left-
most column of Figure 1. In total, this produced approxi-
mately 30 000 very sparse features. As part of the hyper-
parameter selection we used a sparsity ﬁlter to emove non-
informative ones.
We also calculated the similarity of each compound to
2 500 known toxicophore features, ie., patterns of substruc-
tures that were previously reported as toxicophores in the

literature (Kazius et al., 2005). We also calculated the sim-
ilarity of each compound with 200 common chemical sub-
structures that appear often in organic molecules.
Additionally, we calculated a number of descriptors based
on the topological and physical properties of each com-
pound.
Typical descriptors for toxicity prediction can
be grouped into 1D, 2D and 3D features (Hong et al.,
2008). Features that revolve around scalar properties such
as counts of occurences for various atom-types, molecular
weight or size are 1D features, while 2D features can be
extracted from the planar chemical structure graph. These
include graph-based features, 2D autocorrelation descrip-
tors as well as van der Waals volume or the sum of Pauling
atomic polarizabilities. Finally 3D structures usually in-
volve force-ﬁeld and quantum-mechanical simluations to
extract things like solvent accessible surface area or partial
charge informations.
We calculated a variety of these descriptors using off-the-
shelf software (Cao et al., 2013).
However, not all de-
scriptors could be calculated for all compounds. We used
median-imputation to deal with missing values whenever
feasible. This way we obtained a total of 5057 additional
features.
2.4. Implementation
Depending on hyperparameter settings, our deep neural
network had to deal with up to 40 000 input features and
very large hidden layers. We stored the weight parameters
on a single GPU with 12 GB RAM and used mini-batches
of 512 samples for stochastic gradient descent learning.
Since storing our input data in dense format requires about
5 TB of disk space, we used a sparse storage format. How-
ever, it proved to be faster to upload a mini-batch in sparse
format to the GPU and then convert it to dense format in-
stead of using sparse matrix multiplication.
3. Experimental Results
3.1. Tox21 Data Challenge Data
We validated our approach using the data from the Tox21
Data Challenge (National Center for Advancing Transla-
tional Sciences, 2014), a toxicity prediction challenge or-
ganized by the Tox21 program partners open to partici-
pants worldwide.
The data for this challenge was col-
lected within the framework of the Tox21 research initia-
tive, which aims to produce highly realiable measurements
with stringent quality-control criteria, that are otherwise
hard to come by in public databases.
The data set provided by the Tox21 Data Challenge in-
cluded approximately 12 000 compounds and was com-
posed of twelve different sub-challenges/tasks. Each sub-
challenge required the prediction of a different type of tox-
icity. The sub-challenges were split between two panels:
Seven of the twelve sub-challenges dealt with Nuclear Re-
ceptor (NR) signaling pathways, the remaining ﬁve with
the Stress Response (SR) pathways.
Nuclear receptors are important components in cell com-
munication and control, and are involved in development,
metabolism and proliferation. They have been shown to
play a key role in toxicology as well (Woods et al., 2007).
The Tox21 data set investigated several NRs involved in
endocrine system, i.e., the secretion of hormones into the
blood stream, as toxins can cause disruption of the nor-
mal endocrine function. Two such nuclear hormone re-
ceptors, the estrogen and the androgen receptor, have been
measured by two independent systems, once using a lu-

minescence method, and once using a modiﬁed antibi-
otic resistance gene (NR.ER and NR.ER.LBD / NR.AR and
NR.AR.LBD respectively). Furthermore, the challenge in-
cluded a task on predicting the antagonists of the aro-
matase enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of andro-
gen to estrogen and thereby keeps the balance between
these two hormones (NR.Aromatase). The last two NRs
in the Tox21 data set were the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(NR.AhR) which is essential for reacting to a cell’s environ-
mental changes, and a speciﬁc subtype of the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (NR.PPAR.gamma) which
is involved in the regulation of various genes as well as
metabolism. Overall the NR tasks included a broad variety
of different toxicity-related receptors.
Toxicity can also cause cellular stress which in term can
lead to apoptosis. Therefore the Tox21 data also includes
ﬁve tasks on various stress response indicators: The an-
tioxidant response element signaling pathway (SR.ARE) di-
rectly reacts to oxidative stress, while the heat shock factor
response element (SR.HSE) is involved in reacting to heat
shocks as part of the cell’s internal repair mechanisms. The
ATAD5 signaling pathway will be activated when a cell de-
tects DNA damage (SR.ATAD5). The SR panel also in-
cludes a task on predicting which compounds inﬂuence the
mitochondrial membrane potential (SR.MMP), which is es-
sential for generating the energy a cell consumes. Finally,
the p53 task requires participants to detect activation of the
p53 pathway (SR.p53), a well known cancer pathway which
is activated both by DNA damage, but also reacts to vari-
ous other cellular stresses. For this reason, a compound
that triggers any of the other stress response pathways has
a high probability to also show up as active on the p53 task.
In general, all of the SR tasks show higher correlation with
each other than the nuclear receptor tasks (c.f. Figure 3).
Most of the compounds were measured on several of the
tasks (c.f. Figure 2), such that all the tasks operated on
subsets of the same overall data set. This allowed us to
compute correlations between the tasks, displayed in Fig-
ure 3.
As expected, the tasks that involved measuring
the same pathway via different methods (AR/AR-LBD and
ER/ER-LBD) were highly correlated. Also, the p53 path-
way, which is one of the main focal points of stress re-
sponse signaling, showed high levels of correlation with
the other tasks that measured speciﬁc stress responses.
Overall, the compounds were split into a training set con-
sisting of 11 764 compounds with known labels, a leader-
board set used to rank participants on a public leaderboard
(297 compounds) as well as a private test set used for the
ﬁnal evaluation of all submitted entries (643 compounds).
The labels for the leaderboard set were initially held back,
but later made available to the participants in the ﬁnal
stages of the competition, while the labels of the ﬁnal test
set have not yet been released.

3.1.1. DATA PREPROCESSING
The Tox21 training set contains redundant compounds that
appear multiple times within the data, but each time ac-
companied by carrier molecules such as water, salts or
other solubles. Also, we observed compounds that actu-
ally consisted of two unrelated structures, but which for
some unknown reason where encoded together. We semi-
automatically labeled these fragments, cleaning up contra-
dictory and combining agreeing compounds. This way we
identiﬁed 8,695 distinct compound fragments.
To further clean up the data, we made ran a standard

clean-up routine for chemical compounds on the data us-
ing ChemAxon. This made all hydrogen atoms explicit,
ensured that aromatic bonds and tautomers where coded
consistently and uniﬁed the encoding of salts. We then cal-
culated the input features as described in subsection 2.3.
3.2. Evaluation
We deﬁned cross-validation sets for hyperparameter selec-
tion, optimizing for two goals: a) The class-distributions
should be close to the ﬁnal test set. In the training set many
compounds were only measured on a small subset of as-
say, whereas we expected compounds in the ﬁnal test set
to be labeled on all twelve tasks. We therefore included
only compounds that were labeled on at least eight tasks
in the cross-validation sets. The remaining, sparsely la-
beled compounds were added to the training set of each
fold. b) The cross-validation sets should not be overly sim-
ple. We wanted to avoid the situation where the training
samples were exceedingly similar to the test samples. This
happens frequently within chemical data because a number
of compounds might share the same chemical backbone.
Therefore, we clustered the compounds according to their
structural similarity (Verbist et al., 2015) and distributed the
resulting clusters among the ﬁve cross-validation folds.
We used the AUC score as quality criterion, which we op-
timized independently for each task. So even though we
employed multi-task networks, we optimized the hyperpa-
rameters differently for each task at hand.
3.3. Multitask Learning
Most of the compounds where labeled on several of the
tasks (c.f. Figure 2), which allowed us to calculate the cor-
relation between different tasks. As can be seen in Figure 3,
the twelve different task of the Tox21 Data Challenge Data
were highly correlated with one another. Thus, this was an
ideal setting for multi-task learning.
To see whether multi-task learning really helps in this sce-
nario as much as it did when predicting biological activities
on protein level (Dahl et al., 2014), we also trained single-
task neural networks on the same tasks.
As shown in Table 2, in almost all tasks the multi-task
learning approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the single task
networks. Both networks failed in one task which suffered
from very unbalanced class distribution (only 3 positive ex-
amples in the leaderboard set).
3.4. Learning Toxicophore Representation
One of the hallmarks of Deep Learning are several lay-
ers of hierarchical representations of increasing abstrac-
tions (Bengio et al., 2013). Within the chemical research
community such a hierarchy of features has naturally
emerged: single atoms are grouped together as functional
groups and reactive centers, which in turn deﬁne toxi-
cophores (c.f. Figure 1. Such features are the state-of-
the-art way that chemists and drug designers think about
the properties of each chemical compound (Kazius et al.,
2005). To determine the effectiveness of Deep Learning for
toxicity prediction, we investigated whether the network
did implicitly encode toxicophore features in its hidden lay-
ers.
We trained a multi-task deep network on the Tox21 data us-
ing exclusively ECFP4 ﬁngerprint-features as input. Each
ﬁngerprint encodes how many times a speciﬁc, small chem-
ical substructure appears within a compound. No other in-
put features were used.
After training, we computed the correlation between the
activations of the hidden units and the presence/absence
of known toxicophore features in the compounds. We did
indeed ﬁnd several highly signiﬁcant correlations, clearly
demonstrating that the hidden units of a neural network do
indeed automatically learn toxicophore structures.
Visual inspection of the results showed that lower layers
did tend to learn smaller features, often focusing on sin-
gle functional groups like e.g. sulfonyl-groups (see row 1
and 2 of Figure 4, while in higher layers the correlations
were more with larger toxicophore clusters, even involving
structures that did not match the toxicophore perfectly (row
3 of Figure 4.
4. Results
The Tox21 Data Challenge Data attracted a large crowd of
participants from all over the world, including submissions

from leading research labs and industry.
The ﬁnal evaluation was done by the organizers on a held
back evaluation set consisting of 643 compounds.
The
teams were allowed to send in predictions for these ﬁnal
compounds, but did not receive any feedback as to how
well they fared. The ﬁnal scoring on each sub-challenge
was based on the AUC values of each team’s ﬁnal submis-
sion.
Our approach which was spearheaded by the deep neural
network presented in this paper showed the most consistent
performance of all participants: It never placed lower than
ﬁfth place in any of the tasks, and outright won a total of
8 of the 15 challenges. In particular, it achieved the best
average AUC in both the SR and NR panels, as well as
as well as the best average AUC over the whole set of sub-
challenges. It was thus declared winner of both the Nuclear
Receptor and the Stress Response pannel, as well as the
overall Tox21 Grand Challenge. The detailed results are
displayed in Table 3.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we applied of deep neural networks to toxicity
prediction. We showed that deep networks are able to learn
a highly effective representation of chemical compounds.
In this representation we could detect toxicophores, proven
concepts which have previously often been handcrafted
over decades by experts in the ﬁeld. It stands to reason that
these representations also include novel, previously undis-
covered toxicophores that are lying dormant in the data.
Using these representations, our approach outperformed
methods that were speciﬁcally tailored for toxicological ap-
plications.
As demonstrated by the Tox21 Data Challenge, our method
sets a new state of the art in this ﬁeld. As the NIH con-
ﬁrmed (National Center for Advancing Translational Sci-
ences, 2015), the high quality of the models makes them
suitable for deployment in leading edge toxicological re-
search. We believe that Deep Learning has the ability to
greatly inﬂuence the ﬁeld of toxicity prediction in the fu-
ture. Toxicology is a crucial part of modern environmental
health, drug development and pharmaceutical research, and
machine learning is on the verge of becoming a vital part
of it.
