1. Introduction 
In the mid 1980s, as genomic sequences in the Genbank database reached their first 
million nucleotides, a few intrepid biologists turned their attention towards screening 
DNA sequences for the presence of known RNA genes (mostly tRNA at this time) and RNA 
motifs such as ribozymes or specific stem-loop structures. They soon realized this task 
was harder than finding homologues of protein-coding genes, since non-coding RNAs 
were defined not only by their primary sequence, but by a combination of sequence and 
secondary structure.  
Thirty years and hundreds of new RNA families later, this view still holds, albeit with wide 
variations between individual RNA molecules. For instance, some RNAs have sequence 
signatures that are stronger than those of most protein-coding genes. Fig. 1A shows an 
alignment of the Escherichia coli tRNAAla and its homologue in the Bacillus subtilis 
genome. Although the two species are separated by billions of years of evolution, their 
tRNAs have retained more than 90% identity. Such homologues may be efficiently 
identified using a sequence alignment program such as Blast [1]. One may argue, 
however, that tRNAs are very special molecules: they sustain selective pressure at many 
sequence positions due to their multiple and universal functions. But experience has 
shown that a variety of RNA genes, including fast evolving ones such as microRNAs, are 
also well characterized at the sequence level and can be efficiently detected using 
sequence comparison programs [2]. Yet, for many other RNAs, primary sequence 
information is not sufficient for accurate detection. Certain RNA genes such as the RNase

P RNA present little if any conserved sequence, and most RNA structural motifs such as 
GNRA and E-loops, SECIS elements, U-turns or Rho-independent transcription terminators 
are composed of a few key nucleotides associated with a larger secondary structure 
scaffold. Fig. 1B shows consensus structures of the loop E [3] and U-turn [4] motifs, whose 
functions are conferred by a small set of conserved nucleotides embedded into a larger 
stem-loop structure. Such motifs cannot be identified using sequence comparison and 
require specialized programs that take into account both secondary structure and 
sequence constraints. Mining genomic sequences for RNA elements may thus entail using 
very different approaches depending on the type of element under scrutiny.  
Freyult et al. [5] published a detailed comparison of the performance of various RNA 
detection programs using simulated sequence sets, and Menzel et al. [2] proposed a more 
qualitative evaluation of three programs based on “real-life” sequence sets. Here our 
purpose is not to evaluate programs but instead to help readers choose the most 
appropriate program for different situations and present practical execution examples for 
each of the programs. This article updates and expands our previous one in this series [6]. 
The proposed tasks are accessible to any junior bioinformatician or biologists with a basic 
knowledge of Unix commands. We provide links to official download sites for the various 
bioinformatics programs at the end of the Chapter. We assume that all the required 
programs are properly installed by a system administrator on a computer running the 
Linux or another Unix operating system.

2. Choosing the Right Search Program 
RNA search programs can be roughly divided in two classes: descriptor-based and 
homology-based. Descriptor-based programs allow biologists to describe, using a defined 
syntax, the sequence and structure of an RNA motif and search this motif in genome 
databases. The most widely used program in this family is RNAMOTIF [7]. Homology-
based programs constitute a very diverse family. The most popular of them is Blast [1], 
which uses a single sequence as input and identifies segments of similarity in a sequence 
database. The HMMER program [8] uses a sequence alignment as input and, 
consequently, is able to exploit variation and conservation in the gene or motif. The last 
category of homology search programs, exemplified by ERPIN [9] and INFERNAL [10], use 
multiple sequences and a description of secondary structure to perform the search. 
Knowledge of secondary structure allows these programs to identify parts of an RNA 
motif that are completely variable in sequence while retaining a constant structure. In 
Table 1, we present an overview of the qualities and domains of application of the 
different programs.

3. Overview of the RNA Search Procedure 
Any serious RNA search should address the question of secondary structure. Knowledge 
of an RNA secondary structure opens the way to the most sophisticated and sensitive 
search programs. It may also provide important clues about the function of an RNA. If a 
conserved structure is present in the RNA under study, then it must be identified. There 
are well-known programs for predicting an RNA secondary structure from sequence.


## Page 4

However, it is believed that on average about 30% of the base pairs predicted by these 
programs are incorrect. This false prediction rate is definitely too high if one wants to 
discover further RNAs based on this information. Much more reliable structure prediction 
can be achieved using a set of homologous RNAs and seeking a secondary structure that 
is compatible with all sequences in the set. A typical RNA search begins with a step of 
sequence collection to create this first training set. This can be done using a purely 
sequence-based program such as Blast. Once this first set is completed, a common RNA 
structure is derived using a program that simultaneously folds and aligns the sequences in 
the set. Until recently, such algorithms were considered as too computationally expansive 
to be applicable to real-life situations and biologists were reduced to align RNAs using a 
sequence-based multiple-aligner such as CLUSTALW [11], which often yield poorly aligned 
structures. However, recent progress allows reasonably accurate simultaneous alignment 
and folding. We chose the LOCARNA [12] program that presents the advantage of running 
on a web server.  
Once a structured alignment is available, it needs to be carefully inspected. Are we sure 
all RNAs in the set are homologues? Are they complete? Are there obvious 
misalignments? Some manual curation may be helpful at this stage. Then, one should 
identify the most conserved sequence and structure elements. This consideration dictates 
which program can be used to seek further homologues. If no obvious conserved 
secondary structure stands out, we recommend pursuing with further rounds of BLASTN 
and the HMMER program. If short sequence/structure motifs appear, then one may use 
RNAMOTIF to seek further instances of these motifs. If a conserved structure including 
several stems and loops is visible, then one might resort to more sophisticated programs 
that will take these structures into account. ERPIN is useful when a core of regular stems 
is present. INFERNAL is preferred when structures are more variable. The latter is the 
most general and powerful of all programs used in this Chapter, but it is also the slowest, 
although recent developments have brought its search speed closer to that of other 
programs.  
As further RNAs of the family are discovered using any of the above tools, they can be 
used to enrich and improve the structural alignment so that further search iterations can 
be performed. The steps of a typical RNA search can be summarized as in Fig. 2. All search 
programs accept sequence databases in the Multifasta format. Recent versions have 
practically no limitation in the size or number of sequences in the input file.   
4. Assessing Search Specificity 
Most sequence and motif search programs compute a score and an expectation value (E-
value) for each hit. An E-value tells us how many hits could be obtained by chance with 
the same score or higher in a random database of same size. An E-value above 1 or even 
0.1 is likely to occur by chance. Any E-value below 10-2 should in principle convince peer 
scientists that a biologically related motif has been found. However, keep in mind that a 
low E-value does not demonstrate biological significance, as it is subject to artifacts 
caused for instance by low complexity regions in genomes. Conversely, hits with a poor E-
value may turn out to be true homologues that have diverged a lot. Also note that E-
values depend on the database size. When a search program is run repeatedly on


## Page 5


- 5 - 
separate sequence files (e.g. with one file per chromosome), the E-value is valid only for 
each distinct file.  
RNAMOTIF is the only program in our protocol that does not automatically compute E-
values. In this case, or when E-values are not trusted for some reason, it is common to 
use an expected density of False Positives (e.g. FP per Mb) as a measure of specificity. To 
this aim, we may run the search against a randomized sequence database. Random 
sequences with a uniform nucleotide composition (25% each) are not advised, since 
background compositions (single-nucleotide and di-nucleotide frequencies) strongly 
affect the number of chance hits: for instance, an AU-rich motif is more likely to occur in 
an AU-rich sequence background. It is therefore important to reproduce in the negative 
control set the overall compositional biases of the target database. Several programs can 
do this. We will use shuffle, by S. Eddy (see Section Program Versions and Download 
Sites), that randomizes a sequence while preserving the single- and dinucleotide 
frequencies.  
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Outline of a typical RNA motif search protocol. The protocol starts with a BLASTN sequence 
collection followed by structural alignment (align & fold) and the use of a specialized search 
software.  
 
The randomization procedure can be performed on the target database, so that each 
genome in the database is shuffled using its own compositional characteristics. When the 
search database is not decided beforehand, an alternative option is to shuffle the training 
set itself. This is a very conservative approach, as a randomized training set, owing to its


## Page 6


- 6 - 
limited sequence space, is more likely to give rise to false positives than any other 
sequence.  
If specificity has to be quantified, the negative set should, ideally, be large enough to find 
at least a few False Positives. By default, the shuffle program produces a sequence of 
same size as the input sequence. When using a short sequence such as the training set, 
the shuffling procedure must be iterated to produce a random sequence of the desired 
size. For instance: 
 
shuffle -d -n 100 trset.fasta > trset.rnd  
 
Here the sequence to be randomized is in file trset.fasta (multi-fasta format) and the 
output is redirected to trset.rnd. The –d option is used to preserve dinucleotide 
composition in the random sequence, and -n 100 specifies 100 shuffling iterations.  The 
randomized sequences from each iteration round are concatenated and will thus be 100 
times larger than the original sequence.  
5.  A Test Case: Looking for Homologues of a Bacterial 
sRNA 
Our test challenge here is to discover homologues of a bacterial small RNA (sRNA) gene 
named RsaE, a 113-bp RNA first identified in Staphylococcus aureus [13, 14]. We will try 
to stay as close as possible to a “real life” situation, which means we assume only one 
instance of the RNA molecule is known first (here the S. aureus RsaE), and no structure 
information is available. This is the situation shown in the first box of Fig. 2. The initial, 
experimentally confirmed, sequence is entered in the Fasta format in a file named 
rsae.fa (see Section 7, “Supplemental data”), as follows: 
 
>Rsae 
AUGAAAUUAAUCACAUAACAAACAUACCCCUUUGUUUGAAGUGAAAAAUUUCUCCCAUC 
CCCUUUGUUUAGCGUCGUGUAUUCAGACACGACGUUUUUUUAU 
 
Our objective is to find all other instances of this sequence in bacterial genomes. Our 
search database will contain all complete genomes retrieved from the NCBI web site. An 
initial set of genomes from 1080 species was downloaded in 2010 and reduced to 732 
species by retaining a single instance of each species. The sequences are saved in a single 
multi-Fasta file of about 2.5 Gb named 732bacs.fa (see Section 7). To simplify command 
lines, we assume all data files are present in the working directory.  
 
5.1 
BUILDING A FIRST TRAINING SET WITH BLASTN 
Blast is the program of choice for a fast and easy identification of a first set of 
homologues. Biologists are familiar with the NCBI BLAST web interface. Here we use the 
command line version of the program. An advantage of using command line is that users 
can scan “private” sequences not yet included in the NCBI sequence databases. 
Furthermore, playing with parameters is faster with command lines. We assume a recent 
version of BLAST (such as 2.2.25) is installed on the reader’s workstation.


## Page 7


- 7 - 
A local BLAST run requires a properly formatted database. Formatting our database file 
732bacs.fa is done using: 
 
makeblastdb -in 732bacs.fa -dbtype 'nucl' 
This command generates several index files required for BLAST runs. You should not 
worry about the names of these files, as you will always refer to the Fasta file name (here 
732bacs.fa) for further operations. There are several programs in BLAST. Here we use 
BLASTN, which is used to scan nucleic acid databases for nucleic acid sequences. With our 
data files, a simple BLASTN command would look like: 
 
blastn -db 732bacs.fa -query rsae-sau.fa  
 
The command takes about 0.7 seconds to execute and produces a lot of output. It is 
pretty difficult to understand how many hits were exactly recorded. A simpler table 
output can be obtained using the –outfmt 7 parameter, such as in:  
 
blastn -db 732bacs.fa -query rsae.fa -outfmt 7 
 
Now we can count 12 hits from 12 different species. Are they all statistically significant 
though? The lowest scoring hit is from the Geobacillus strain WCH70. Its E-value of 3 x 10-
11 is highly significant. We can control the E-value cutoff using the –evalue parameter, for 
instance by appending -evalue 0.01 to the BLAST command.  
Can we find more distant homologues using BLASTN? This question is commonly 
addressed by reducing word size. In BLAST, both the database and the query sequences 
are broken down into k-length words (k-words). BLAST is able to quickly scan these word 
lists for exact or near-exact matches. Longer alignments with possible gaps and 
mismatches are generated only after one k-word match is found. This enables a very fast 
search at the risk of missing some hits that would contain no exact or near-exact k-word 
match. The default word size for BLASTN is 25. It can be changed using the word_size 
parameter. Shorter words will increase sensitivity, at the cost of longer runtimes. Let’s 
reduce word size to 10: 
 
blastn -db 732bacs.fa -query rsae.fa -outfmt 7 -evalue 0.01 –word_size 10 
 
The command now takes 2.1 seconds to run, but finds 21 hits from different species, that 
is nine more than with the default word size. Note how significant these new alignments 
are. The lowest scoring hit is now found in Geobacillus kaustophilus, and has an E-value of 
9 x 10-10, which is still very significant. Reducing word size to its minimum value (k=5) 
extends runtime to nearly 1 minute but does not reveal further solutions.  
This list of 21 BLAST hits is a good starting point for further analysis. We should now 
extract the corresponding sequences. The latest version of BLAST provides useful output 
controls. It is now possible to retrieve automatically the matched sequences and other 
items using parameter -outfmt 10 followed by the desired item names. For instance 
replacing -outfmt 7 in the above command with -outfmt “10 evalue sseqid sseq” will 
output the E-value, database sequence Id and matching sequence region in the database 
for each hit.


## Page 8

A visual inspection of these sequences reveals that several species share the exact same 
RsaE sequence. After discarding the redundant hits, our raw training set is composed of 
14 distinct sequences. Before going any further, we should pay attention to the species 
distribution of these sequences. We have found RsaE in Staphylococcus, Macrococcus, 
Bacillus, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Lysinibacillus. These genera all belong to the 
“Bacilli” class of the Firmicute phylum. This is an important observation that supports the 
relevance of the hits. Hits distributed in multiple distant phyla would be a warning sign of 
possible false positives.   
 
5.2 
ALIGNMENT AND STRUCTURE PREDICTION 
As explained above, establishing the RNA secondary structure is an important step for 
further homology search. To this aim, we will use the LOCARNA program [12] through its 
Freiburg web server. LOCARNA belongs to a family of programs that simultaneously align 
and fold a set of RNA sequences. These programs are known to provide better RNA 
alignments than those relying only on sequence. The LOCARNA server is intuitive and 
works fine with default parameters. We can just paste the 14 Fasta-formatted sequences 
into the input window. To produce a Fasta file from the BLAST output, any text editor will 
do. As LOCARNA does not accept gap characters, we will use the editor to remove gaps 
too. The Fasta-formatted raw training set is available as Suppl. file trset.fa (see Section 
7). The LOCARNA server displays the structural alignment after a few minutes. The output 
is shown in Fig. 3A with parentheses representing the secondary structure. This predicted 
structure is remarkably similar to the one established for S. aureus using chemical and 
enzymatic probing [13] (Fig. 3B).  
LOCARNA, like any other multiple alignment program, does not produce perfect 
alignments. For instance, the AAAC in the 5’ region of G. kaustophilus RsaE would 
probably be aligned better with the AAAC segments found in all other sequences. To keep 
things simple, we will not try to improve this alignment manually, and we will proceed 
with the one in Fig. 3A.  
It appears from our alignment that RsaE homologues differ in their 3' regions.  Either 
some RNAs are actually shorter, or this may be an effect of the BLAST program failing to 
extend the alignment to its actual ending. To settle this, it is necessary to retrieve the 
corresponding regions from the bacterial genomes and observe their sequence. This can 
be done using the coordinates from the BLAST output and any genome browser such as 
the Ensembl Bacterial Genome Browser (http://bacteria.ensembl.org/). We retrieved the 
missing 3’ regions and realigned the sequences using LOCARNA. These 3’ regions differed 
strongly from other RsaE sequences and aligned poorly both at the sequence and 
structure level (not shown). Therefore we can assume that these 3’ regions are either 
missing or too different from the original RsaE sequence to be kept in our alignment. We 
also noted that the G. kaustophilus sequence lacked about 15 nt in its 5’ region. We 
retrieved the corresponding segment from the genome sequence and used it for the 
LOCARNA alignment. The extended sequence aligned nicely with other RsaE sequences 
although parts of the long 5’ stem appeared not to be conserved. The extra segment 
(italics) was incorporated into Fig. 3A.


## Page 9


- 9 - 
The RsaE initial alignment presents a long stem on the 5’ side. However, the sequence of 
this stem is highly conserved and there is little evidence of covariation that would indicate 
the base pairs are under evolutionary pressure. Therefore we cannot be absolutely sure 
about this secondary structure. The 3’ part, which is missing in half the sequences is a 
typical Rho-independent transcription terminator, with a stem loop followed by a U-rich 
region. We may hypothesize that the RsaE sequences lacking this terminator use another 
termination mechanism.

5.3 
SEARCHING WITH HMMER 
A sequence alignment is a powerful means of conducting homology searches, even in 
the absence of secondary structure information. The main reason is that an alignment 
permits to distinguish variable regions that are not crucial for RNA function from 
conserved, crucial regions, and thus enables weighting matches accordingly. A good way 
to exploit an alignment is to use the HMMER package [8]. HMMER converts the alignment 
into a profile Markov model that records both the statistics of base frequencies in each 
alignment column as well as that of consecutive bases in neighbouring columns. Once a 
profile HMM model is built from the alignments, matches to this model in sequence 
databases can be sought using the dynamic programming algorithm in HMMER. First, the


## Page 10


- 10 - 
training alignment should be formatted in the Stockholm format, as shown in suppl. file 
trset.stk. Here is the command to build the profile HMM: 
 
hmmbuild trset.hmm trset.stk 
 
This creates a file named trset.hmm, which can be used for scanning genome sequences. 
The search command is then entered as follows:  
 
hmmsearch trset.hmm 732bacs.fa 
 
After a runtime of 42 seconds, we obtain 18 solutions. These include new Bacillus 
and Geobacillus species, as well as an entire new genus, Oceanobacillus, that was 
absent in the initial training set. This HMMER hit is shown in Fig. 4. The figure 
legend explains the different output items. The default mode of hmmsearch uses 
several heuristics to speed up the search, at a certain cost for search sensitivity. 
It is possible to switch off the heuristics using the –-max option. This slows down 
the search by a factor of 10, but reveals no novel significant hit in our case.   
 
 
Fig. 4. Part of an HMMER output. The local hit is shown with 5 lines. The “CS” line is just a 
reminder of the secondary structure in the .stk file, which is not used by HMMER, the next three 
lines show the consensus profile, matching residues and target sequence, and the last line shows 
the posterior probabilities of each aligned residue which is an indication of alignment reliability. 
Values range between 0 and *, with 0 corresponding to a 0-5% probability, up to * for a 95-100% 
probability that this residue was produced from the hidden markov model created from the input 
alignment. 
 
 
5.4  
SEARCHING WITH RNAMOTIF 
The RNAMOTIF program permits to describe an RNA motif, including sequence and 
secondary structure constraints, and to find all instances of this motif in a sequence 
database. Therefore, a major difference from the previous approaches is that we can now 
use secondary structure information. A typical RNAMOTIF descriptor is shown in Fig. 5A. 
Let’s take a quick look at this language. The first section (parms), says that G:U pairs are 
allowed in addition to Watson-Crick pairs. The next section (descr) is the actual 
descriptor, listing all secondary structure elements. There are three types of elements: h5 
stands for the 5’ strand of a helix, h3 for the 3’ strand of a helix, and ss for a single strand. 
When no other indication is provided, RNAMOTIF assumes pairing between h3 and h5 
elements in a purely nested fashion, just as in a parenthesis notation. Non-nested helices


## Page 11


- 11 - 
(i.e. pseudoknots) require a special tag that modifies this default behavior. Associated to 
each h5, h3 or ss element is a list of optional parameters that specify minimum and 
maximum length, conserved sequences, conserved base pairs, etc. By default, RNAMOTIF 
reports all sequences matching the descriptor. Sometimes, however, additional filters are 
required that cannot be applied at the “descr” level. An optional score section is used for 
this purpose. In this section, tests can be performed using a C-like computer language, 
and matches are rejected if the tests fail. For an in-depth explanation of RNAMOTIF 
descriptors and scoring functions, refer to the detailed manual included in the program. 
 
 
Fig. 5. RNAMOTIF descriptors for RsaE. A. This descriptor uses three stems with variable 
sequences and six single strands containing conserved sequences. B. This descriptor uses a single 
60-nt single strand with a long conserved 3’ motif. C. This descriptor splits the previous single 
strand in three parts. In the last part, a mismatch is allowed in the consensus motif.  
 
Let’s see how our knowledge of the RsaE RNA can be turned into an efficient descriptor. 
We will use only the most basic features of the RNAMOTIF language. To build our first 
descriptor (Fig. 5A), we make the typical assumption that a regulatory RNA has variable 
sequences in the secondary structure helices and conserved sequences in single-stranded 
regions, as the latter are supposed to undergo tertiary interactions. This is of course a 
simplistic view, but we would like to see how it performs. We set helix lengths as in the 
Fig. 3 consensus (size = 6, 4 and 6 nt, respectively from 5’ to 3’). To account for shorter 
helices, we allow 1 mismatch per helix (mispair=1) and, since the default behavior of this 
parameter restricts mispairs to internal positions, we use ends='mm' to allow for mispairs 
at helix ends. We specify conserved sequences in several single-stranded segments. The


## Page 12


- 12 - 
most conserved single-stranded region is the apical loop where the conserved seven 3’-
proximal bases are specified by seq="ACCCCUU$". In the fifth “ss” region seq="^A" means 
that this strand should start with an A. We save this descriptor file as descriptor.txt and 
we are now ready to look for instances of this motif in our database. The basic RNAMOTIF 
command then looks like: 
 
rnamotif -descr descriptor.txt 732bacs.fa 
 
The run takes about 1 minute and produces a pretty large output. It is better to use a 
redirection to store hits in an output file. Also, due to variations in helix sizes and 
positions, RNAMOTIF tends to generate several overlapping solutions for each actual 
motif. The utility program rmprune is provided to filter out these overlapping solutions and 
retain only the highest scoring one at each site. This program is executed in combination 
with RNAMOTIF using the “pipe” sign (|) as follows: 
 
rnamotif -descr descriptor.txt 732bacs.fa |rmprune > outfile 
 
From now on, we will assume that every RNAMOTIF run is performed using |rmprune > 
outfile. We can now count 16 solutions produced by the RNAMOTIF run. Sample outputs 
are shown in Fig. 6. Most hits are from the genera Bacillus, Macrococcus, Staphylococcus, 
and Anoxybacillus. A few training set sequences such as the Geobacilli are missing, which 
indicates our descriptor is too strict in some respects. Indeed, we can see in the alignment 
that shorter helices #2 and #3 in G. kaustophilus do not match the descriptor constraints.

entry. Line 2: Sequence name, score (here our descriptors do not include a scoring section hence 
all scores are 0), strand (“0” indicates plus strand and “1” minus strand), hit position, hit length in 
nt. Line 3: hit sequence, with stems and single-stranded elements separated by spaces. A. A hit 
from the descriptor in Fig. 5A. B. Two hits from the descriptor in Fig. 5C. 
 
 
Interestingly, only four sequences are from species outside our training set. Considering 
the large size of the database, this is a small number. These include one hit from 
Anaerococcus prevotii (Fig. 6A). Albeit distant in the phylogenetic tree, this species

belongs to the Firmicutes, as do the other known RsaE sequences, and is therefore an 
interesting candidate to consider. However, we observed that the sequence just following 
the motif is not as CU-rich as in other RsaE sequences. The other new hits are from phyla 
that are very distant from Firmicutes and therefore unlikely to contain an RsaE 
homologue. We can reasonably assume they are false positives.  
To assess the significance of new RNAMOTIF hits, we advise using a shuffled database as a 
control. Here we will randomize our bacterial genome database while preserving the 
dinucleotide frequencies, using the shuffle command as this: 
 
shuffle -d 732bacs.fa > 732bacs.rnd 
  
Running the same RNAMOTIF descriptor on the shuffled database 732bacs.rnd produces 
6 hits. This is a clear warning that the few hits obtained with real data can be false 
positives.  
Examination of the RsaE alignment suggests that sequence alone may describe RsaE 
better than secondary structure. The stems are indeed highly conserved in sequence and 
show no sequence covariation to support their base-pairing potential. Let’s see how 
efficient our RsaE search could be by using solely primary sequence constraints. All RsaE 
members harbor a constant AAAC motif followed by a highly conserved CU-rich sequence 
that is repeated in tandem. The descriptor in Fig. 5B describes one copy of the tandem 
motif in a single line. The syntax for sequence constraints in RNAMOTIF is that of Unix 
regular expressions. The “^” sign indicates the beginning of the element and the string 
.\{2,10\} describes a sequence of 2 to 10 unspecified bases, described by the dot 
character. This simple motif performs surprisingly well. After 75 seconds, RNAMOTIF 
identifies 27 hits, covering all the species in the training set plus several other species 
from the same genera and one hit in Pectobacterium wasabiae, an enterobacterium. 
Enterobacteria are very distant from Firmicutes, which makes this hit an unlikely RsaE 
candidate.  
Running the descriptor in Fig. 5B against the shuffled genome database produces a single 
hit, which shows that our simple sequence motif is more specific than the complex 
secondary structure motif in Fig. 5A. Can we now relax this descriptor and find additional 
candidates? RNAMOTIF allows for mismatches in sequence motifs, using the mismatch=n 
parameter (n being the number of allowed mismatches). However, the mismatch 
parameter is compatible only with regular expressions of constant length. Therefore we 
cannot allow for mismatches in a variable region of size 2 to 10 as above. We thus have to 
rewrite our descriptor using distinct ss elements, as shown in Fig. 5C.  
The descriptor in Fig. 5C that tolerates one mismatch in the CU-rich region takes longer to 
run (2 minutes) than the exact descriptor and produces 71 solutions. In addition to new 
species from the same genera as above, these include a number of apparent false 
positives from Cyanobacteria or Enterobacteria, plus new Firmicutes candidates of the 
genera Streptococcus and Clostridium (Fig. 6B). These results should be considered with 
caution though, as the false positive ratio has increased significantly. We now find 35 hits 
in the randomized database (not shown).    
A possible control to evaluate the new candidates is to analyze the sequence downstream 
of the motif. We can see in the training set (Fig. 3) that the downstream sequence is a 
near exact repeat of the central conserved region. Flanking sequences around a given

- 14 - 
motif are easy to extract using RNAMOTIF by adding new “ss” elements of desired length 
with no sequence constraint. We used this to obtain the 30 nt of downstream sequences. 
This sequence is not UC-rich in Streptococci, but it is in one of the Clostridia, C. 
phytofermentans (Fig. 6B). Therefore this candidate may be considered further.  
We can see that RNAMOTIF is a valuable tool to test ideas about what determines an RNA 
motif. We have developed highly specific descriptors in just minutes, using either primary 
or secondary structure information. One important limitation of RNAMOTIF though is its 
lack of an objective scoring function. Although the program accepts user-defined scoring 
functions, their quality will depend on the user’s appreciation of the RNA motif.  The 
subsequent protocols address this issue.  
 
5.5 
SEARCHING WITH ERPIN 
ERPIN circumvents the descriptor design problem by extracting information directly from 
a structure-annotated alignment and building log-odd score profiles for each stem and 
single-stranded segment in the alignment.  
 
 
Fig. 7. ERPIN data formats. A. Typical ERPIN input file (.epn file) showing secondary structure (first 
three lines) and aligned sequences (next lines). The format is explained in text. B. A .epn file 
displayed using the tview command. Each secondary structure element, S (single-stranded) or H 
(helical), is highlighted with element number (read vertically) and sequence conservation 
(asterisk).


## Page 15


- 15 - 
First, we need to convert the alignment into the ERPIN format. Fig. 7A shows how the first 
lines of our RsaE alignment should look like. The first three lines provide secondary 
structure information. In this example, the secondary structure is the same as the 
parenthesized structure in Fig. 3, but each structural element (single-stranded or helical) 
is assigned a different number that is read vertically. When distant segments have the 
same number (e.g. 02 or 04 in this example), the corresponding element is understood to 
be helical, otherwise it is single-stranded. The secondary structure lines can be created 
manually using a text editor, or automatically from a parenthesized secondary structure 
file using the parent2epn.pl script provided in the ERPIN distribution. The lines following 
the structure information contain the aligned sequences in the classical FASTA format.  
The initial parenthesized secondary structure had a single long single-stranded segment 
composed of elements 17 and 18.  Element 18 (the terminator) is not present in all 
sequences while element 17 is present everywhere and is highly conserved. To enable 
searching for the conserved part while ignoring the other, it is preferable to split this 
single-stranded segment into two different elements. We thus created element 18 using a 
text editor. Our ERPIN formatted alignment was saved as trset.epn (suppl. data).  
The tview command is useful to visualize constraints in the sequence alignment: 
 
tview trset.epn 
 
The result is shown in Fig. 7B. ERPIN users must decide which part of the alignment is 
used for the search. A direct search for a multiple-element region could be prohibitive in 
terms of CPU and memory usage, especially when elements vary a lot in size. Here, the 
alignment suggests that the region from the 5’ side of helix 02 to single strand 17 is the 
most conserved (asterisks on top). We will thus launch the search using this region (we 
assume all ERPIN commands below are complemented by –silent > outfile in order to 
send output to file outfile, devoid of trace text). 
 
erpin trset.epn 732bacs.fa -2,17 –nomask 
 
The minus sign before 2 is used to specify the 5’ part of stem 02. The –nomask argument 
indicates that all elements in the region should be used for the search. We will see later 
how we can mask/unmask elements. The ERPIN command takes as much as 4 days to be 
executed, producing 21 solutions. A sample is shown in Fig. 8A. The solutions cover all 
species from the training set, plus a few closely related species. The search is highly 
specific, with all E-values around 10-20, however it takes a long time and does not find 
distant homologues.  
Using the whole structure for search is thus not very practical here (4 days run!), and it 
can become worse for RNA motifs containing more elements, more gaps or fewer 
conserved regions than the RsaE RNA. More gaps in single-stranded segments (helices 
cannot contain gaps) and more variation in the alignment means longer search times and 
reduced search specificity. One way to reduce runtime is to restrict the search to a 
smaller conserved region. For instance we can use the region from single strand 9 to 
single strand 17:  
 
erpin trset.epn 732bacs.fa 9,17 –nomask


## Page 16


- 16 - 
The search time is now down to a more reasonable 10 hours and ERPIN finds the same 21 
hits as before. However, because of the different search region, the hit sequences and E-
values are different (Fig. 8B).  
 
 
Fig. 8. Extracts of ERPIN outputs. Hits are formatted as follows. Line 1: title line of Fasta file entry. 
Line 2: Forward (FW) or Reverse (RC) strand, a fixed tag, hit positions, PWM score and E-value. 
Line 3: hit sequence. Structural elements are separated by dots. Consecutive dots indicate that 
corresponding elements were not included in the ERPIN command. Gaps inside elements are used 
to align the hit sequence onto the training alignment. A, B, C: results of different ERPIN runs (see 
text).  
 
It is relatively easy to further decrease CPU time by implementing a search strategy. The 
main idea is to perform a stepwise search using masks. In the first step, one should mask 
most of the selected region and retain only a few key elements. ERPIN will disregard all 
masked elements and restrict search to the unmasked part. The best parts to unmask 
during the first step are those conserved elements that occur rarely in the database and 
are in close proximity to each other so that they are quickly identified. Then, at each 
successive step, one unmasks additional elements for ERPIN to look for. ERPIN will 
consider these latter elements only after elements have been identified in the first round. 
Any number of search steps can be specified on the same command line. For our RsaE 
motif, let’s try the following 2-step strategy: 
 
erpin trset.epn 732bacs.fa 9,17 -umask 17 –nomask 
 
In this command, we first unmask element 17, then unmask the whole region. The search 
time is reduced to 26 minutes and this does not change the number of solutions. To 
increase search sensitivity and find more distant homologues, we now need to play with 
scores and pseudocounts. Default cutoff scores are set for each element in order to


## Page 17


- 17 - 
capture the lowest scoring member of the training set. Pseudocounts are used to allow 
for additional variation in regions that have as yet displayed very little variation, such as 
strand 17 in Fig. 7. Playing with scores and pseudocounts can become relatively complex 
and is beyond the scope of this Chapter. Interested readers should refer to the Erpin 
documentation. However, the Perl script erpincommand.pl provided with the ERPIN 
distribution can suggest a reasonable ERPIN command using cutoff and pseudocounts to 
achieve a balanced specificity / sensitivity ratio. The script is run as follows: 
 
erpincommand.pl trset.epn 
 
and it suggests the following command: 
 
erpin trset.epn DATABASE -09,18  -add 09 17 -pcw 51  -cutoff 41.96 
 
Running this command (replacing DATABASE by our actual database file name) produces 
23 hits after a 176 minutes run. Some hits have poor E-values (1 or more). To filter hits, 
we can use the script readerpin.pl, as follows, assuming ERPIN output was redirected to 
outfile: 
 
readerpin.pl < outfile –e 1 
 
This prints out only those hits with an E-value below 1. There are 21 such hits, and the list 
is the same as before, hence no new significant hit was found. However, one of the two 
high E-value hits (E = 2.82) is from Oceanobacillus iheyensis, a member of Bacilli that was 
not in the training set and was also found by HMMER (Fig. 8C). This confirms the strength 
of this candidate. 
 
5.6 
SEARCHING WITH INFERNAL 
INFERNAL uses covariance models to describe a structural RNA sequence alignment and 
subsequently locates instances of this model in genome database. A covariance model is a 
probabilistic description of the sequence and structure constraints in the training set. It is 
more general than the model used by ERPIN with the caveat that it cannot take 
pseudoknot constraints into account. Early versions of INFERNAL required amounts of 
computing power that kept the program out of reach of most biology labs. However, 
version 1.0 implemented heuristic filters that increased search speed considerably and 
rendered INFERNAL searches accessible to anyone with basic command line skills.  
First the following command should be executed in order to produce the covariance 
model from the Stockholm structural alignment trset.stk we created above in the 
HMMER section. 
 
cmbuild trset.cm trset.stk 
 
The output covariance model is written in file trset.cm. In principle, a database scan is 
possible using this file. However, in order to benefit from E-value calculation and 
performance-enhancing filters, the model must be processed using the cmcalibrate 
command, as follows: 
 
cmcalibrate trset.cm


## Page 18


- 18 - 
This command is more CPU-intensive than the cmbuild command. It requires about 40 
minutes in our example, but it can take much longer with complex multi-helix motifs. 
When it terminates, the cm file is changed to incorporate calibration information. We can 
now run the search over our 732 genome database using the cmsearch command, as 
follows: 
 
cmsearch trset.cm 732bacs.fa 
As cmsearch is relatively slow, we highly recommend using output redirection and the 
nohup command that enables a program to keep running even if the terminal window is 
closed: 
 
nohup cmsearch trset.cm 732bacs.fa > outfile & 
 
Here the & sign is used to execute the task in the background. This run takes about 10 
hours and finds 26 solutions. In addition to the Firmicute species found by other 
programs, four identical hits are found in different Listeria species (Fig. 9). Listeria are 
Firmicutes and E-values around 0.01 indicate that these are serious candidates. Some 
Listeria hits were found with HMMER but with E-values above 1.  
 
 
Fig. 9. Extract of an INFERNAL output. Lines 1-4 provide general information about the hit shown 
below: coordinates of hit in the alignment (query), coordinates of hit in the database sequence 
(target), score, E-value, P-value and GC-content of hit. The alignment shows the hit sequence 
(bottom) and the consensus sequence from the training alignment (top). The middle line shows 
conserved bases. Special characters on top of the alignment show the secondary structure in a 
bracket notation.  
 
6. Conclusion 
I have presented five different protocols for RNA motif search, based on BLAST, HMMER, 
RNAMOTIF, ERPIN and INFERNAL. In absolute terms, the usefulness of an RNA search 
protocol lies primarily in its precision, or balance between specificity and sensitivity. 
However practicality is of course important too. In the above examples, the INFERNAL-
based protocol was probably the most effective as it found significant candidates that


## Page 19

none of the other approaches identified, while enabling reasonable runtimes and 
command line complexity. However, the diversity of RNA motif search situations is such 
that alternative protocols should always be considered. Motifs with little or no 
conservation information are best tackled using RNAMOTIF, motifs based on a 
pseudoknot are best dealt with ERPIN or RNAMOTIF, and motifs with highly variable or 
uncertain secondary structures should be addressed preferentially using HMMER or 
BLAST. The biologist’s eye thus remains instrumental in the process of RNA motif search.
