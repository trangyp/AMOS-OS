# CIL Culture Interface Layer

> [!abstract] Canon Function
> **CIL — Culture Interface Layer** is the cultural and linguistic contextualization layer of the Universe Canon.
>
> Its governing purpose is to preserve **localized semantic fidelity** when meaning crosses languages, cultures, communities, interpretive conventions, symbolic systems, or context boundaries.
>
> CIL adapts the **representation and interpretation interface** of meaning. It MUST NOT silently rewrite the underlying canonical claim merely to make that claim culturally familiar, persuasive, elegant, or locally conventional.

---

# 0. Canonical Statement

The source-established statement is:

> **Cultural and linguistic contextualization engine ensuring localized semantic fidelity.**

This note expands that statement into an operational Universe Canon contract.

The expansion distinguishes:

```text
SOURCE-ESTABLISHED
    |
    +-- CIL is a Culture Interface Layer
    +-- CIL performs cultural contextualization
    +-- CIL performs linguistic contextualization
    +-- CIL targets localized semantic fidelity

MODEL-ELABORATED
    |
    +-- transformation contracts
    +-- fidelity invariants
    +-- ambiguity handling
    +-- localization receipts
    +-- provenance requirements
    +-- validation gates
    +-- failure states
    +-- replay requirements
```

Where the authoritative Universe Canon defines additional CIL semantics, that canon supersedes model elaboration.

---

# 1. Governing Objective

CIL exists to solve the transformation:

```text
Meaning
   |
   v
Source Context
   |
   v
Cultural/Linguistic Boundary
   |
   v
CIL
   |
   v
Localized Representation
   |
   v
Meaning Preserved
```

The target is not literal surface identity.

The target is:

```text
semantic fidelity
+
contextual appropriateness
+
scope preservation
+
epistemic preservation
+
provenance preservation
```

subject to the constraints of the target cultural and linguistic environment.

---

# 2. Core CIL Contract

For source meaning `M_s`, source context `C_s`, source language `L_s`, target culture `C_t`, and target language `L_t`:

```text
CIL(
    M_s,
    C_s,
    L_s,
    C_t,
    L_t
)
    ->
M_t
```

where `M_t` is a target representation intended to preserve the load-bearing semantics of `M_s`.

The desired invariant is:

$$
Meaning(M_t \mid C_t,L_t)
\approx
Meaning(M_s \mid C_s,L_s)
$$

The approximation symbol is intentional.

Cross-cultural and cross-linguistic equivalence is not assumed to be perfect.

Where exact semantic equivalence cannot be established:

```text
CIL MUST expose the residual gap.
```

---

# 3. Semantic Fidelity Invariant

Let:

```text
S(M) = load-bearing semantic content of message M
```

Then the CIL fidelity objective is:

$$
S(M_t) \simeq S(M_s)
$$

within the declared translation/localization scope.

A transformation fails semantic fidelity if it materially changes:

* what is asserted;
* what is denied;
* epistemic strength;
* causal strength;
* uncertainty;
* scope;
* temporal applicability;
* modality;
* obligation;
* permission;
* prohibition;
* identity;
* quantities;
* conditions;
* falsifiers;
* dependencies;
* provenance-relevant attribution.

---

# 4. Interface-Layer Principle

CIL is an **interface layer**.

Therefore:

```text
CIL may transform representation.
CIL may transform explanation.
CIL may transform examples.
CIL may transform linguistic form.
CIL may transform culturally dependent framing.

CIL MUST NOT silently transform canonical truth conditions.
```

Formally:

$$
Transform(Interface) \neq Rewrite(Canon)
$$

---

# 5. Representation ≠ Canon Mutation

A localized representation is not automatically a new canonical claim.

```text
Canonical Claim
      |
      v
CIL Transformation
      |
      v
Localized Representation
```

does not imply:

```text
Localized Representation
      =
New Canonical Claim
```

Unless an explicit canon mutation process authorizes it.

---

# 6. Source Meaning Envelope

Every consequential CIL transformation SHOULD construct a source meaning envelope.

```yaml
source_meaning_envelope:

  claim: null

  claim_class: null

  language: null

  cultural_context: null

  semantic_atoms: []

  protected_terms: []

  quantities: []

  conditions: []

  scope:
    population: null
    environment: null
    scale: null
    time: null
    regime: null

  modality: null

  causal_strength: null

  uncertainty: null

  provenance: []

  falsifiers: []
```

This envelope identifies what cannot safely drift during localization.

---

# 7. Target Context Envelope

CIL SHOULD also declare the target applicability environment.

```yaml
target_context:

  language: null

  locale: null

  culture: null

  community: null

  audience: null

  domain: null

  register: null

  formality: null

  literacy_assumptions: null

  specialist_knowledge: null

  temporal_context: null

  jurisdiction: null

  communication_medium: null
```

Not every field is required for every transformation.

Only decision-relevant context should be loaded.

---

# 8. Contextualization Function

CIL contextualization can be represented as:

$$
M_t =
f(
M_s,
C_s,
L_s,
C_t,
L_t,
D,
R,
A
)
$$

where:

```text
D = domain
R = epistemic / interpretive regime
A = audience context
```

The transformation function must preserve load-bearing semantics even when surface form changes substantially.

---

# 9. Localization ≠ Literal Translation

CIL distinguishes:

```text
TRANSLATION
LOCALIZATION
TRANSCREATION
EXPLANATION
CULTURAL ANALOGY
TERMINOLOGY MAPPING
INTERPRETATION
CANON MUTATION
```

These are not interchangeable operations.

Literal translation may preserve words while losing meaning.

Localization may change words while preserving meaning.

Therefore:

```text
lexical similarity
≠
semantic fidelity
```

---

# 10. Translation Mode

Translation attempts to represent source content in another language.

```yaml
operation:
  type: TRANSLATION

  permitted:
    - linguistic reformulation
    - grammatical restructuring
    - idiomatic substitution

  prohibited:
    - unsupported claim strengthening
    - unsupported claim weakening
    - silent factual substitution
    - silent scope expansion
```

---

# 11. Localization Mode

Localization adapts content to a target locale or cultural environment.

It may alter:

* date presentation;
* number formatting;
* units;
* examples;
* idioms;
* address conventions;
* honorifics;
* explanatory order;
* culturally dependent references.

But:

```text
localization convenience
MUST NOT override semantic integrity.
```

---

# 12. Transcreation Boundary

Transcreation permits greater expressive transformation.

Because semantic drift risk is higher, it must be explicitly typed.

```yaml
operation:
  type: TRANSCREATION
  semantic_drift_risk: HIGH
  canon_mutation_allowed: false
```

A transcreated representation must not be presented as a literal translation.

---

# 13. Cultural Analogy Boundary

CIL may use culturally familiar analogies to explain unfamiliar concepts.

But:

$$
Analogy(A,B)
\not\Rightarrow
Identity(A,B)
$$

and:

$$
StructuralSimilarity(A,B)
\not\Rightarrow
Causation(A,B)
$$

Therefore a cultural analogy remains explanatory unless independently established as stronger.

---

# 14. Terminology Preservation

Canon-specific terms SHOULD remain stable when translation would destroy their technical identity.

Examples may include:

```text
RSCF
GMEF
Proof Capsule
Causal Epoch
MVCC
CAS
Universe Canon
CIL
```

A localized gloss may accompany the term.

Pattern:

```text
CANONICAL_TERM (localized explanation)
```

rather than silently replacing the canonical identifier.

---

# 15. Protected-Term Registry

```yaml
protected_terms:

  - canonical_term: null
    localized_term: null
    translation_policy:
      preserve_original: true
      gloss_allowed: true
      substitution_allowed: false

    semantic_constraints: []
```

Protected terminology prevents vocabulary localization from silently changing architecture.

---

# 16. Semantic Atomization

Before consequential localization, complex content SHOULD be decomposed into checkable semantic atoms.

Example:

```text
SOURCE:
"System X may operate under condition Y, but only while assumption Z remains valid."
```

Atoms:

```text
A1: System X may operate.
A2: Operation is conditional.
A3: Condition Y is required.
A4: Assumption Z is load-bearing.
A5: Validity ends if Z fails.
```

The localized output must preserve these atoms.

---

# 17. Atom Preservation Invariant

For load-bearing semantic atoms:

$$
A_s = \{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}
$$

and localized atoms:

$$
A_t = \{a'_1,a'_2,\ldots,a'_m\}
$$

CIL seeks a mapping:

$$
\forall a_i \in A_s,
\exists a'_j \in A_t :
Meaning(a_i) \simeq Meaning(a'_j)
$$

If no safe mapping exists:

```text
mark the atom as NON_PORTABLE or GAP.
```

Do not fabricate equivalence.

---

# 18. Non-Portable Semantics

Some concepts do not have a reliable one-to-one cultural or linguistic equivalent.

CIL must support:

```yaml
portability:
  state: NON_PORTABLE

  source_concept: null

  reason: null

  closest_target_expression: null

  residual_semantic_gap: null

  preserve_source_term: true
```

This is preferable to false equivalence.

---

# 19. Semantic Loss Budget

CIL SHOULD treat semantic loss as an explicit risk.

Conceptually:

$$
Loss =
S(M_s) - RecoverableMeaning(M_t)
$$

This is not necessarily numerically measurable.

It is a validation model.

Possible states:

```text
NONE_DETECTED
MINOR
MATERIAL
CRITICAL
UNKNOWN
```

A critical semantic loss invalidates the localized output.

---

# 20. Semantic Addition Risk

Localization can also add unsupported meaning.

Let:

$$
Addition =
S(M_t) - SupportedMeaning(M_s)
$$

Examples include adding:

* certainty;
* causal interpretation;
* moral judgment;
* cultural assumptions;
* universal applicability;
* authority;
* intent.

Unsupported additions are semantic defects.

---

# 21. Fidelity Equation

A conceptual CIL quality function may be represented as:

$$
F_{CIL}
=
F_s
\cdot
F_e
\cdot
F_c
\cdot
F_p
$$

where:

```text
F_s = semantic preservation
F_e = epistemic preservation
F_c = contextual compatibility
F_p = provenance preservation
```

This equation is a model abstraction, not a canon-established quantitative metric unless separately specified.

The weakest load-bearing component limits the final confidence.

---

# 22. Epistemic Fidelity

CIL must preserve conclusion strength.

Mappings must not silently transform:

```text
VERIFIED    -> certain fact
DERIVED     -> verified observation
MODEL       -> reality
CONDITIONAL -> unconditional
COMPETING   -> resolved
UNKNOWN     -> false
UNKNOWN     -> true
SOURCE_CLAIM -> independently verified
```

These are invalid epistemic escalations.

---

# 23. Claim-Class Preservation

```yaml
claim_class_mapping:

  source_class: null
  target_class: null

  preserved: UNKNOWN

  transformation_authorized: false
```

Default rule:

$$
Class(M_t) = Class(M_s)
$$

unless new independent evidence justifies reclassification.

Translation itself never provides that evidence.

---

# 24. Uncertainty Preservation

Suppose the source says:

```text
"This may occur."
```

A localization that means:

```text
"This occurs."
```

is invalid.

Likewise:

```text
"likely"
≠
"certain"

"possible"
≠
"probable"

"unknown"
≠
"unlikely"
```

Uncertainty is semantic content.

---

# 25. Scope Preservation

Every important claim carries an applicability envelope.

CIL must preserve relevant scope across:

```text
population
culture
language
environment
jurisdiction
scale
time
regime
measurement method
assumptions
```

A locally appropriate explanation must not silently universalize a scoped claim.

---

# 26. Scope Leakage Example

Source:

```text
"In jurisdiction J, procedure P is required."
```

Invalid localization:

```text
"Procedure P is required."
```

because jurisdictional scope disappeared.

Correct pattern:

```text
"In jurisdiction J, procedure P is required."
```

with localized explanation if needed.

---

# 27. Temporal Fidelity

Terms such as:

```text
currently
historically
formerly
usually
temporarily
as of [date]
during [epoch]
```

carry semantic scope.

CIL must preserve them where load-bearing.

Removing temporal qualifiers may turn a bounded statement into a false universal.

---

# 28. Modal Fidelity

CIL distinguishes:

```text
MUST
SHOULD
MAY
MUST NOT
CAN
CANNOT
RECOMMENDED
REQUIRED
PERMITTED
PROHIBITED
```

Modal terms must not be casually normalized.

For example:

```text
SHOULD
≠
MUST
```

and:

```text
MAY
≠
WILL
```

---

# 29. Causal Fidelity

CIL must preserve causal typing.

Do not translate:

```text
associated with
```

as:

```text
causes
```

Do not translate:

```text
enables
```

as:

```text
guarantees
```

Do not translate:

```text
necessary condition
```

as:

```text
sufficient condition
```

Causal strength is load-bearing meaning.

---

# 30. Causal Firewall

CIL recognizes distinctions among:

```text
association
correlation
mechanism
enabling condition
necessary condition
sufficient condition
mediation
confounding
feedback
causal effect
```

Localization must preserve these distinctions whenever relevant.

Cultural familiarity cannot license causal escalation.

---

# 31. Negation Fidelity

Negation is protected.

Examples:

```text
is
≠
is not

allowed
≠
not allowed

required
≠
not required
```

Double negatives, negative concord, and language-specific negation structures require explicit validation when ambiguity could change meaning.

---

# 32. Quantity Fidelity

CIL must preserve quantitative semantics.

Protected quantities include:

```text
numbers
ranges
thresholds
ratios
percentages
probabilities
dates
durations
units
orders of magnitude
```

Unit localization is permitted only with mathematically valid conversion.

---

# 33. Unit Conversion Boundary

For a quantity:

$$
q_s u_s
$$

localized into unit `u_t`:

$$
q_t = Convert(q_s,u_s,u_t)
$$

The conversion must preserve physical quantity within appropriate precision.

Formatting changes are not mathematical evidence.

---

# 34. Proper-Name Fidelity

Names, organizations, places, canonical identifiers, and formal titles require controlled transformation.

Possible policies:

```text
PRESERVE
TRANSLITERATE
TRANSLATE_OFFICIAL_NAME
TRANSLATE_WITH_ORIGINAL
LOCAL_ALIAS_WITH_CANONICAL_REFERENCE
```

The selected policy should preserve identity.

---

# 35. Transliteration ≠ Translation

```text
TRANSLITERATION:
script/sound representation

TRANSLATION:
meaning representation
```

They must not be conflated.

A transliterated term may remain semantically opaque.

A translated term may lose identity.

CIL chooses based on the governing objective.

---

# 36. Cultural Context

Meaning may depend on culturally embedded conventions.

Examples include:

* politeness;
* hierarchy;
* directness;
* honorifics;
* kinship terms;
* legal conventions;
* social roles;
* metaphor;
* taboo;
* ritual;
* historical references;
* institutional assumptions.

CIL may contextualize these dimensions without claiming that a culture is homogeneous.

---

# 37. Anti-Essentialism Constraint

A cultural label is not sufficient evidence that every individual within that population shares a behavior, belief, or interpretation.

Therefore:

```text
culture-level pattern
≠
individual-level fact
```

CIL must avoid silently converting cultural context into deterministic stereotypes.

---

# 38. Intra-Cultural Variation

Target context may vary by:

```text
region
generation
profession
education
community
religion
institution
dialect
sociolect
medium
historical period
individual preference
```

Where variation materially changes interpretation, CIL should preserve competing localized interpretations rather than forcing one universal rendering.

---

# 39. Dialect and Register

CIL may adapt language across:

```text
formal
informal
technical
academic
legal
conversational
ceremonial
professional
youth
regional
```

Register adaptation is valid only if semantic strength remains stable.

---

# 40. Audience Adaptation

CIL can adjust explanatory complexity.

For example:

```text
technical audience
-> technical terminology

general audience
-> accessible explanation

novice audience
-> expanded context
```

But simplification must not erase load-bearing qualifications.

---

# 41. Simplification Boundary

Valid:

```text
complex expression
-> simpler equivalent expression
```

Invalid:

```text
complex conditional truth
-> simple unconditional claim
```

Therefore:

$$
Simplification \neq SemanticReduction
$$

when the removed semantics are decision-relevant.

---

# 42. Idiom Handling

Idioms should be treated by meaning, not merely lexical composition.

Possible strategies:

```text
TARGET_EQUIVALENT
PARAPHRASE
PRESERVE_AND_GLOSS
LITERAL_WITH_WARNING
NON_PORTABLE
```

The selected strategy should minimize semantic distortion.

---

# 43. Metaphor Handling

Metaphors can encode:

* emotional framing;
* causal implication;
* cultural reference;
* value judgment;
* conceptual structure.

A target metaphor should not be substituted merely because it sounds natural.

It must preserve the relevant semantic role.

---

# 44. Humor Boundary

Humor is especially culturally sensitive.

A localized joke may change:

* target;
* social meaning;
* offensiveness;
* implied judgment;
* political meaning;
* power relationship.

Therefore humor localization has elevated semantic-drift risk.

```yaml
risk:
  operation: humor_localization
  default_level: HIGH
```

---

# 45. Politeness Boundary

Languages encode politeness differently.

CIL may adapt:

* pronouns;
* titles;
* honorifics;
* indirectness;
* request structure;
* greetings.

However politeness adaptation must not transform:

```text
request -> command
suggestion -> obligation
permission -> requirement
```

unless source meaning supports it.

---

# 46. Cultural Safety Without Semantic Deletion

CIL may choose culturally appropriate presentation.

But:

```text
avoidance of discomfort
≠
permission to delete truth conditions
```

If accurate localization conflicts with expected cultural framing, CIL should preserve the claim and explain the contextual mismatch.

---

# 47. Canonical Identifier Rule

Canonical identifiers SHOULD remain machine-stable.

Example:

```text
CIL
L22_REPLAYABILITY
L23_MVCC_CAS
L24_CAUSAL_EPOCH
RSCF
GMEF
```

Human-facing labels may be localized.

Machine identity should remain stable unless the authoritative canon defines localized IDs.

---

# 48. Dual Representation

A robust localization may preserve both canonical and localized forms:

```text
Canonical:
CIL Culture Interface Layer

Localized:
[target-language representation]

Canonical ID:
CIL
```

This allows human accessibility without sacrificing graph identity.

---

# 49. CIL Transformation Receipt

Every consequential transformation SHOULD be capable of emitting a receipt.

```yaml
cil_receipt:

  receipt_id: null

  operation:
    type: LOCALIZATION

  source:
    artifact_id: null
    digest: null
    language: null
    culture: null

  target:
    language: null
    culture: null
    locale: null
    audience: null

  protected_semantics: []

  protected_terms: []

  non_portable_elements: []

  transformations: []

  semantic_drift:
    detected: UNKNOWN
    severity: UNKNOWN

  validation:
    result: UNKNOWN

  provenance: []

  epoch: null
```

---

# 50. Transformation Provenance

CIL should preserve:

```text
source artifact
source version
source digest
transformation type
target locale
translator/model/engine identity where applicable
validation method
timestamp/epoch
output digest
```

Without provenance, later reviewers may be unable to distinguish canonical source text from localized derivative text.

---

# 51. Derivative Identity

A localized artifact is a derivative representation.

Conceptually:

```text
SOURCE
  |
  +-- CIL[en-US] -> DERIVATIVE_A
  |
  +-- CIL[vi-VN] -> DERIVATIVE_B
  |
  +-- CIL[ja-JP] -> DERIVATIVE_C
```

These derivatives share ancestry.

Therefore:

```text
three translations of one source
≠
three independent sources
```

---

# 52. Provenance Topology

CIL must preserve ancestry to prevent false independence.

```text
              SOURCE S
              /  |  \
             /   |   \
           T1    T2   T3
```

`T1`, `T2`, and `T3` are correlated descendants.

Agreement among them does not independently confirm `S`.

---

# 53. Sybil Resistance Principle

A single claim translated into many languages must not gain epistemic weight merely because it appears in many localized artifacts.

Formally:

$$
EvidenceWeight(T_1,\ldots,T_n)
\neq
n \times EvidenceWeight(S)
$$

when all translations descend from source `S`.

---

# 54. Cultural Consensus Boundary

Repeated cultural acceptance of a claim may be socially informative.

It does not independently prove the claim's empirical truth.

```text
cultural consensus
≠
empirical verification
```

Likewise:

```text
linguistic prevalence
≠
truth
```

---

# 55. Source Authority Boundary

An authoritative source may determine canonical terminology or governance meaning within its authority scope.

Authority does not automatically establish empirical truth outside that scope.

CIL preserves this distinction.

---

# 56. Regime Preservation

Localization occurs inside an epistemic regime.

Possible regimes include:

```text
CANONICAL
EMPIRICAL
SIMULATION
SPECULATIVE
MODEL
```

A CIL transformation must not silently change regimes.

```yaml
regime:
  source: null
  target: null
  bridge_required: false
```

Default:

```text
target regime = source regime
```

---

# 57. Regime Firewall

Example:

```text
SOURCE:
"This is defined by the AMOS Canon."
```

Invalid localization:

```text
"This is scientifically proven."
```

because:

```text
CANONICAL
->
EMPIRICAL
```

occurred without evidence.

---

# 58. Cultural Model ≠ Empirical Culture

A CIL cultural model may represent assumptions about communication patterns.

It must not be confused with verified facts about every member of a culture.

Therefore:

```text
CIL cultural profile
=
MODEL
```

unless independently validated for a defined population and context.

---

# 59. Context Freshness

Cultural and linguistic conventions change.

CIL context therefore has freshness requirements.

```yaml
freshness:

  temporal: null
  environmental: null
  regime: null
  provenance: null
  scope: null
  model: null
  source: null
```

A once-valid localization may become stale.

---

# 60. Temporal Cultural Drift

Terms may change meaning over time.

Therefore:

$$
Meaning(term,t_1)
\not\equiv
Meaning(term,t_2)
$$

in all cases.

Historical text must be interpreted within its historical linguistic context when that difference is material.

---

# 61. Semantic Versioning

Localized terminology may need version control.

```yaml
cil_semantic_version:

  term: null

  source_definition_version: null

  localization_version: null

  valid_from: null

  valid_until: null

  supersedes: null
```

This prevents new meanings from silently rewriting historical interpretations.

---

# 62. No Semantic Time Travel

A later preferred translation must not silently alter what an earlier artifact said.

Instead:

```text
Translation_v1
      |
      v
explicit supersession
      |
      v
Translation_v2
```

Historical representations remain reconstructable.

---

# 63. Replayability

Given pinned:

```text
source bytes
source language
source context
target language
target context
CIL rules
terminology registry
validator version
```

the deterministic portion of CIL should be replayable where deterministic replay is claimed.

Conceptually:

$$
Replay(RootInputs,Receipt)
=
RecordedOutput
$$

for the deterministic surface.

---

# 64. Replay Boundary

Natural-language generation may contain nondeterministic elements unless constrained.

Therefore CIL must distinguish:

```text
semantic replay
```

from:

```text
bit-for-bit replay
```

Bit-for-bit deterministic replay requires exact implementation support and pinned execution conditions.

It must not be assumed merely from conceptual CIL architecture.

---

# 65. Semantic Replay

Where byte-identical output is unnecessary, a semantic replay validator may test whether a regenerated localization preserves the same protected semantic atoms.

This is weaker than bit-for-bit replay.

```text
semantic equivalence
≠
byte identity
```

---

# 66. State Integrity

A localization should be bound to the source state it was created from.

```text
read source version V
localize source V
validate against source V
commit derivative of V
```

If the source changes before commit:

```text
ABORT
or
REVALIDATE
```

rather than silently publishing a stale localization.

---

# 67. CAS-Style Publication Gate

Conceptually:

```text
expected_source = H(source_at_start)

localized = CIL(source_at_start)

current_source = H(source_at_commit)

if current_source != expected_source:
    ABORT(STALE_SOURCE)

else:
    COMMIT(localized)
```

This expresses state-integrity discipline.

It does not independently establish literal hardware or database CAS implementation.

---

# 68. Epoch Binding

Every consequential localized artifact SHOULD record the canon epoch against which it was generated.

```yaml
epoch_binding:

  source_epoch: null
  localization_epoch: null
  contract_epoch: null
```

If source canon crosses an epoch boundary, affected localizations require revalidation.

---

# 69. Selective Invalidation

If only one source concept changes, only dependent localized representations should be invalidated where dependency closure is computable.

```text
changed source atom
      |
      v
dependent translations
      |
      v
selective revalidation
```

Unrelated localized content remains valid unless shared dependencies exist.

---

# 70. Dependency Graph

```yaml
cil_dependencies:

  source_artifact: []

  terminology_registry: []

  cultural_context_models: []

  language_models: []

  canonical_definitions: []

  validation_rules: []

  external_references: []
```

Hidden dependencies weaken replayability and provenance.

---

# 71. Cultural Context Dependency

If interpretation relies on a cultural assumption:

```text
A_culture
```

that assumption becomes load-bearing.

Therefore the localized conclusion's confidence cannot exceed confidence in `A_culture` unless independently revalidated.

---

# 72. Weakest-Premise Ceiling

For load-bearing premises:

$$
P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n
$$

a CIL confidence ceiling obeys conceptually:

$$
Conf(CIL_{output})
\leq
\min_i Conf(P_i)
$$

unless independent evidence revalidates the affected conclusion.

---

# 73. Ambiguity Detection

CIL must detect ambiguity that can alter meaning.

Ambiguity classes include:

```text
LEXICAL
SYNTACTIC
REFERENTIAL
PRAGMATIC
CULTURAL
TEMPORAL
MODAL
CAUSAL
SCOPE
DOMAIN
```

---

# 74. Ambiguity Contract

```yaml
ambiguity:

  detected: false

  class: null

  interpretations: []

  decision_relevant: false

  resolution_evidence: []

  state: RESOLVED
```

If multiple interpretations remain equally plausible and decision-relevant:

```text
preserve COMPETING interpretations.
```

---

# 75. Competing Interpretations

Example:

```text
Source Phrase
    |
    +-- Interpretation A
    |
    +-- Interpretation B
```

CIL must not arbitrarily select A merely because it is more fluent.

Correct output may be:

```text
COMPETING:
A — ...
B — ...
Discriminating context required: ...
```

---

# 76. Discriminating Evidence

When competing translations exist, CIL should seek the cheapest high-information discriminator.

Possible discriminators:

* surrounding text;
* canonical glossary;
* author definition;
* domain convention;
* historical usage;
* target audience;
* explicit source clarification.

More translations of the same ambiguous phrase are not necessarily useful evidence.

---

# 77. Glossary Priority

Where authoritative terminology exists:

```text
CANONICAL GLOSSARY
>
domain convention
>
contextual inference
>
general-language default
```

subject to provenance and version validity.

This ordering is a model policy unless the authoritative Universe Canon specifies a different precedence.

---

# 78. Definition Preservation

If a canonical term has an explicit definition, CIL should translate the definition rather than infer meaning solely from the term's ordinary-language appearance.

This prevents false cognates and misleading lexical substitutions.

---

# 79. False-Friend Firewall

Words in two languages may look similar while carrying different meanings.

Therefore:

```text
orthographic similarity
≠
semantic equivalence
```

CIL must validate meaning independently when false-friend risk is material.

---

# 80. Domain Firewall

A word may have different meanings in:

```text
law
medicine
physics
philosophy
software
economics
AMOS Canon
ordinary speech
```

Domain context must be preserved.

A culturally natural ordinary-language translation may be wrong in a technical domain.

---

# 81. Canonical Domain Priority

For AMOS-specific canon:

```text
AMOS canonical definition
>
ordinary-language meaning
```

within AMOS canon interpretation.

This does not imply that the AMOS definition governs external domains.

---

# 82. Cross-Domain Mapping Boundary

If CIL maps a concept from one domain to another for explanation:

```text
AMOS concept
~ cultural concept
```

the mapping remains:

```text
MODEL / ANALOGY
```

unless independently validated.

It must not silently become identity.

---

# 83. Ontology Alignment

Cultural systems may partition concepts differently.

CIL may encounter:

```text
one source concept -> multiple target concepts
multiple source concepts -> one target concept
no target equivalent
```

These are ontology-alignment problems, not merely vocabulary problems.

---

# 84. One-to-Many Mapping

```text
Source Concept S
     |
     +-- Target T1
     +-- Target T2
```

CIL must preserve the distinctions required to reconstruct `S`.

If choosing only `T1` loses load-bearing meaning, the mapping is invalid.

---

# 85. Many-to-One Mapping

```text
Source S1 ----\
               -> Target T
Source S2 ----/
```

If `S1` and `S2` are canonically distinct, a shared target word must be disambiguated with qualifiers.

---

# 86. Null Mapping

If no reliable target equivalent exists:

```text
Source S
   |
   v
NO SAFE EQUIVALENT
```

then CIL should:

1. preserve the source term;
2. provide explanation;
3. mark non-portability.

It should not fabricate a culturally convenient equivalent.

---

# 87. Context Compression

CIL may compress explanatory context when safe.

Compression is valid only if removed context cannot materially alter interpretation.

Conceptually:

$$
Compress(C)
$$

is permitted when:

$$
Decision(M,C)
=
Decision(M,Compress(C))
$$

for the relevant decision surface.

This is a model criterion, not necessarily computationally decidable in all cases.

---

# 88. Context Expansion

Sometimes localization requires adding context that the source audience already knows.

Added context must be typed as explanatory.

Example:

```text
[Translator/context note: ...]
```

It must not be merged invisibly into the source claim.

---

# 89. Annotation Separation

CIL SHOULD distinguish:

```text
SOURCE CONTENT
LOCALIZED CONTENT
TRANSLATOR NOTE
CULTURAL NOTE
MODEL INFERENCE
```

This preserves provenance.

---

# 90. Cultural Note Contract

```yaml
cultural_note:

  note_type: EXPLANATORY

  source_supported: null

  external_context: null

  inference: null

  affects_source_claim: false
```

A cultural note cannot silently alter source canon.

---

# 91. Bidirectional Fidelity

A strong localization may be tested by back-translation.

```text
Source
   |
   v
Target
   |
   v
Back-Translation
```

Then compare:

```text
semantic atoms(source)
vs
semantic atoms(back-translation)
```

Back-translation is a useful test.

It is not proof of perfect equivalence.

Two transformations can share the same error.

---

# 92. Independent Validation

Where stakes justify it, CIL validation should use a genuinely different path.

Examples:

```text
Path A:
direct localization

Path B:
independent semantic atom comparison
```

or:

```text
Path A:
translator/model output

Path B:
canonical glossary + bilingual expert review
```

Independence must be demonstrated rather than assumed.

---

# 93. Correlated Validation Warning

These may not be independent:

```text
two outputs from the same model
two translations derived from the same translation memory
two reviewers using the same erroneous glossary
two localized documents copied from one derivative
```

Agreement under shared ancestry can hide systematic error.

---

# 94. Adversarial CIL Validation

For consequential localization, challenge the output for:

```text
semantic omission
semantic addition
epistemic escalation
epistemic weakening
scope leakage
causal escalation
negation inversion
quantity drift
modal drift
identity drift
cultural stereotyping
false equivalence
false cognates
stale terminology
correlated provenance
hidden assumptions
regime crossing
```

---

# 95. Adversarial Test — Omission

Question:

```text
Did the target remove a qualifier necessary for the source claim?
```

If yes:

```text
FAIL
```

when the omission changes load-bearing semantics.

---

# 96. Adversarial Test — Addition

Question:

```text
Did the target introduce a claim absent from the source?
```

If yes, classify the addition.

Possible classifications:

```text
EXPLANATORY
SUPPORTED_CONTEXT
MODEL_INFERENCE
UNSUPPORTED
```

Unsupported load-bearing additions fail validation.

---

# 97. Adversarial Test — Epistemic Drift

Compare:

```text
source confidence
source claim class
source modality
```

against target.

Any unlicensed strengthening is a defect.

---

# 98. Adversarial Test — Cultural Projection

Ask:

```text
Did the localization assume a cultural norm that the evidence does not support?
```

If yes:

```text
downgrade
condition
or remove assumption
```

---

# 99. Adversarial Test — Scope Leakage

Ask:

```text
Did a culturally specific claim become universal?
```

or:

```text
Did a universal claim become culturally restricted without support?
```

Both require correction.

---

# 100. Sensitivity Test

Identify the smallest translation decision capable of flipping the interpretation.

Examples:

```text
one modal verb
one negation marker
one causal verb
one pronoun
one honorific
one legal term
one temporal qualifier
```

Validate that element first.

---

# 101. Fragility Classification

```yaml
fidelity_sensitivity:

  state: UNKNOWN

  flip_points: []

  classification:
    - ROBUST
    - CONDITIONAL
    - FRAGILE
    - UNKNOWN
```

A localization is FRAGILE when small plausible linguistic changes alter load-bearing meaning.

---

# 102. Cultural Risk Classification

```text
C0 — direct low-risk representation
C1 — ordinary localization
C2 — culturally dependent interpretation
C3 — high ambiguity / consequential meaning
C4 — maximum validation required
```

Escalation triggers may include:

* legal consequences;
* medical consequences;
* financial consequences;
* safety implications;
* governance implications;
* identity-sensitive semantics;
* high ambiguity;
* irreversible publication;
* cross-regime mapping.

---

# 103. Adaptive Complexity

CIL should use the smallest sufficient contextualization scope.

Do not load an entire cultural model when a stable dictionary mapping resolves the task.

Escalate only when context can materially change meaning.

```text
minimum sufficient context
>
maximum context accumulation
```

for efficient integrity-preserving localization.

---

# 104. Cultural Context Overload

Excessive contextualization can itself distort meaning.

Potential failure:

```text
simple source claim
+
large cultural narrative
=
target claim dominated by assumptions absent from source
```

Therefore contextualization must remain decision-relevant.

---

# 105. Privacy Boundary

Cultural adaptation should not infer sensitive individual attributes merely from language, location, name, or group association.

A user's language preference does not prove:

* nationality;
* ethnicity;
* religion;
* political ideology;
* cultural identity.

CIL should adapt to declared or contextually necessary language requirements without unsupported identity inference.

---

# 106. Individual Preference Priority

When an individual explicitly declares a linguistic or communication preference, that declared preference can govern interface presentation within its scope.

It does not imply broader cultural identity.

---

# 107. Locale ≠ Culture

```text
locale
≠
culture

language
≠
nationality

country
≠
uniform worldview
```

CIL treats these as distinct context variables.

---

# 108. Cultural Context ≠ Governance Authority

A culturally accepted convention does not automatically override governing canon.

If:

```text
local convention
conflicts with
canonical invariant
```

CIL may explain the difference.

It must not silently rewrite the invariant.

---

# 109. Governance Bridge

Where localized requirements genuinely conflict with canon or jurisdictional obligations, route through an explicit governance bridge.

```text
CIL
  |
  v
Conflict Detection
  |
  v
Governance Review
  |
  v
Authorized Decision
```

CIL itself should not manufacture governance authority.

---

# 110. Legal Localization Boundary

Legal terms often lack exact cross-jurisdiction equivalents.

Therefore:

```text
translation of legal term
≠
legal equivalence
```

unless validated within the relevant jurisdictions.

CIL should preserve jurisdiction and avoid implying legal equivalence from linguistic similarity.

---

# 111. Scientific Localization Boundary

Scientific terms should preserve operational meaning.

Cultural familiarity must not change:

* units;
* mechanisms;
* uncertainty;
* evidence strength;
* statistical interpretation;
* causal status.

Popular-language simplification must remain epistemically faithful.

---

# 112. Historical Localization Boundary

Historical concepts should not automatically be mapped onto present-day categories.

If modern terminology changes interpretation:

```text
preserve historical term
+
explain modern approximate mapping
```

rather than silently rewriting historical ontology.

---

# 113. Religious / Philosophical Concept Boundary

Concepts embedded in religious or philosophical systems may be non-portable.

CIL should distinguish:

```text
native concept
approximate translation
interpretive school
model analogy
```

and preserve competing interpretations when authoritative consensus is absent.

---

# 114. Symbolic Systems

CIL may interface with non-prose meaning systems:

```text
symbols
ritual forms
icons
mathematical notation
gesture
color conventions
spatial conventions
```

Meaning is context-dependent.

A symbol familiar in one environment may carry a different or opposite interpretation elsewhere.

---

# 115. Symbol Preservation Contract

```yaml
symbol_mapping:

  source_symbol: null
  source_meaning: null

  target_symbol: null
  target_meaning: null

  equivalence:
    state: UNKNOWN

  ambiguity: []

  validation: []
```

Visual similarity is not sufficient proof of symbolic equivalence.

---

# 116. Formatting Semantics

Formatting can carry meaning.

Examples:

```text
capitalization
quotation marks
bold emphasis
section hierarchy
directionality
punctuation
number separators
date ordering
```

CIL should preserve semantic formatting where relevant.

---

# 117. Writing Direction

For right-to-left and bidirectional scripts, CIL must preserve:

* identifier integrity;
* numbers;
* code;
* equations;
* punctuation;
* embedded left-to-right terms.

Rendering correctness is part of interface fidelity when formatting affects interpretation.

---

# 118. Machine-Readable Fidelity

Localized human text may coexist with stable machine-readable fields.

Example:

```yaml
canonical_id: CIL
localized_title: null
canonical_claim_class: AMOS_MODEL
localized_claim_class_label: null
```

Machine fields should not be translated in ways that break graph or schema identity.

---

# 119. Schema Localization Boundary

Values intended for human reading may be localized.

Schema keys SHOULD remain stable unless the schema explicitly supports localized keys.

Invalid:

```text
different key names in every language
```

when downstream systems require stable identifiers.

Preferred:

```yaml
id: CIL
label:
  en: Culture Interface Layer
  vi: null
  ja: null
```

---

# 120. Search and Retrieval

CIL SHOULD support retrieval across localized aliases while preserving canonical identity.

Conceptually:

```text
localized term
      |
      v
alias resolver
      |
      v
canonical ID
```

This allows multilingual discovery without fragmenting the knowledge graph.

---

# 121. Alias Registry

```yaml
alias_registry:

  canonical_id: CIL

  aliases:
    - language: en
      value: Culture Interface Layer

    - language: null
      value: null
```

Aliases are lookup interfaces.

They do not create separate canonical entities.

---

# 122. Canonical Graph Integrity

All localized aliases should resolve to the same canonical node unless they genuinely represent distinct concepts.

```text
Alias_EN ----\
Alias_VI -----\
Alias_JA ------> CIL_CANONICAL_NODE
Alias_FR -----/
```

This prevents cultural localization from fracturing entity identity.

---

# 123. Collision Detection

Two canonical concepts may map to the same localized term.

CIL must detect this collision.

```yaml
term_collision:

  localized_term: null

  canonical_candidates: []

  disambiguation_required: true
```

Do not silently choose one when ambiguity is decision-relevant.

---

# 124. Identity Collision Example

```text
Canonical A -> "X"
Canonical B -> "X"
```

Target output should introduce qualifiers:

```text
X [A-context]
X [B-context]
```

or preserve canonical terms.

---

# 125. Semantic Drift Monitoring

Repeated localization chains increase drift risk.

```text
SOURCE
  ->
LANGUAGE A
  ->
LANGUAGE B
  ->
LANGUAGE C
```

is generally less provenance-safe than:

```text
SOURCE -> A
SOURCE -> B
SOURCE -> C
```

when direct translation is available.

---

# 126. Source-Rooted Localization

Preferred topology:

```text
                  SOURCE
                /   |   \
               /    |    \
              A     B     C
```

rather than:

```text
SOURCE -> A -> B -> C
```

unless intermediate translation is explicitly required.

---

# 127. Recursive Translation Risk

If translation must occur through intermediates, every hop should preserve:

```text
source identity
intermediate identity
semantic receipt
drift assessment
```

Cumulative uncertainty should not be hidden.

---

# 128. Multi-Hop Confidence

Conceptually:

$$
Conf(T_n)
\leq
\min(
Conf(T_1),
Conf(T_2),
\ldots,
Conf(T_n)
)
$$

for load-bearing translation steps absent independent revalidation.

More hops do not automatically increase confidence.

---

# 129. Error Propagation

If an upstream translation contains an error:

```text
SOURCE
  |
  v
T1 [ERROR]
  |
  +--> T2
  +--> T3
  +--> T4
```

all descendants depending on that translation may require invalidation.

The original source and unrelated branches remain unaffected.

---

# 130. Failure Recovery

CIL recovery follows local repair.

```text
identify failed semantic atom
        |
        v
invalidate dependent mappings
        |
        v
repair mapping
        |
        v
revalidate affected outputs
```

Do not recompute the entire Universe Canon unless dependency closure requires it.

---

# 131. Gap Classification

CIL gaps are classified:

```text
CRITICAL
DECISION-RELEVANT
EXPLANATORY
COSMETIC
```

Resolve in that order.

Examples:

```text
CRITICAL:
unknown meaning of a legal obligation term

DECISION-RELEVANT:
ambiguous causal verb

EXPLANATORY:
missing historical background

COSMETIC:
nonessential stylistic preference
```

---

# 132. Critical Gap Rule

If a critical semantic gap cannot be resolved:

```text
CIL MUST NOT fabricate certainty.
```

Return:

```text
UNKNOWN/GAP
```

or preserve competing interpretations.

---

# 136. Anti-Pattern — Fluent Semantic Drift

```text
SOURCE:
precise but awkward

TARGET:
beautiful but different
```

This is failure.

CIL optimization order is:

```text
integrity
>
semantic completeness
>
fluency
>
brevity
```

---

# 137. Anti-Pattern — Cultural Overwriting

Invalid:

```text
"This culture usually describes X as Y,
therefore the source must mean Y."
```

Cultural convention is contextual evidence, not permission to overwrite explicit source semantics.

---

# 138. Anti-Pattern — Stereotype Localization

Invalid:

```text
target user speaks language L
therefore user believes cultural assumption C
```

Language alone does not establish individual belief.

---

# 139. Anti-Pattern — False Consensus

Invalid:

```text
many localized sources repeat claim X
therefore X has independent confirmation
```

If they descend from one source, provenance remains correlated.

---

# 140. Anti-Pattern — Epistemic Promotion

Invalid:

```text
SOURCE_CLAIM
      |

```

Translation is not validation.

---

# 141. Anti-Pattern — Regime Promotion

Invalid:

```text
AMOS_MODEL
   |
 localization
   v
EMPIRICAL_FACT
```

No cultural interface transformation can independently license this promotion.

---

# 142. Anti-Pattern — Causal Promotion

Invalid:

```text
"linked to"
->
"caused by"
```

unless separate causal evidence supports the stronger statement.

---

# 143. Anti-Pattern — Silent Scope Removal

Invalid:

```text
"under conditions A and B"
->
"always"
```

This is semantic corruption.

---

# 144. Anti-Pattern — Canonical Term Replacement

Invalid when identity matters:

```text
RSCF
->
rough culturally similar concept
```

with the original canonical identity removed.

Use:

```text
RSCF (localized explanatory gloss)
```

instead.

---

# 145. Anti-Pattern — Unmarked Transcreation

Creative adaptation presented as literal translation is provenance failure.

Transcreation must be explicitly typed.

---

# 146. Anti-Pattern — Back-Translation Proof

Invalid reasoning:

```text
back-translation resembles source
therefore translation is proven correct
```

Back-translation is evidence, not conclusive proof.

Shared translation assumptions can preserve the same error.

---

# 147. Anti-Pattern — Authority by Fluency

A native-sounding output is not necessarily accurate.

```text
fluency
≠
fidelity
```

and:

```text
confidence of tone
≠
confidence of evidence
```

---

# 148. Anti-Pattern — Culture as Static

CIL must not assume cultural meaning is timeless.

A cultural model requires:

```text
scope
time
environment
provenance
```

where those dimensions materially affect interpretation.

---

# 149. Anti-Pattern — Universal Audience

There is no guaranteed single target representation optimal for every speaker of a language.

CIL targets a declared context.

---

# 150. Validation Gates

A consequential CIL transformation may pass through:

```text
G1  Source Identity
G2  Source Context
G3  Semantic Atomization
G4  Target Context
G5  Terminology
G6  Semantic Fidelity
G7  Epistemic Fidelity
G8  Scope Fidelity
G9  Causal Fidelity
G10 Quantitative Fidelity
G11 Ambiguity
G12 Provenance
G13 Freshness
G14 Adversarial Validation
G15 Commit-State Integrity
```

---

# 151. Gate Aggregation

For mandatory gates:

$$
PASS_{CIL}
=
\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} PASS(G_i)
$$

Therefore:

```text
14 PASS + 1 critical FAIL
=
FAIL
```

not average success.

---

# 152. Unknown Is Not Pass

```text
NOT_CHECKED
≠
PASS

UNKNOWN
≠
PASS

NO_OBVIOUS_ERROR
≠
PASS
```

A high-stakes localization cannot receive PASS merely because no one noticed a defect.

# 155. CIL Falsifiers

The localized representation is invalidated if evidence establishes any load-bearing failure including:

### F1 — Meaning Reversal

Target meaning contradicts source meaning.

### F2 — Material Omission

A required semantic atom disappears.

### F3 — Unsupported Addition

Target introduces unsupported load-bearing meaning.

### F4 — Epistemic Escalation

Target is stronger than source without evidence.

### F5 — Scope Leakage

Applicability envelope materially changes.

### F6 — Causal Escalation

Association becomes causation or equivalent overreach.

### F7 — Identity Failure

A canonical entity maps to the wrong target entity.

### F8 — Quantity Failure

Numbers, units, thresholds, or dates materially drift.

### F9 — Critical Ambiguity

Multiple materially different interpretations remain hidden.

### F10 — Provenance Break

Target cannot be reliably traced to its source.

### F11 — Stale Source

The source changed after localization without revalidation.

### F12 — Canon Supersession

Authoritative Universe Canon defines different CIL semantics.

---

# 156. Invalidation Scope

A failed localization does not automatically invalidate:

* the source artifact;
* unrelated language versions;
* unrelated semantic atoms;
* unrelated cultural contexts.

Invalidate only dependent conclusions where dependency closure is available.

---

# 157. Revalidation Triggers

CIL revalidation SHOULD occur after:

```text
source mutation
canonical terminology mutation
target-language semantic drift
culture-model update
domain-definition update
epoch transition
new ambiguity discovery
new provenance evidence
successful falsifier
validator change
```

---

# 158. CIL Runtime Contract

Conceptually:

```text
function CIL_LOCALIZE(source, target_context):

    pin(source)

    source_envelope =
        extract_load_bearing_semantics(source)

    context =
        resolve_minimum_sufficient_target_context(target_context)

    mappings =
        map_terms_and_semantics(
            source_envelope,
            context
        )

    if critical_nonportable(mappings):
        expose_gap()

    output =
        generate_localized_representation(mappings)

    validation =
        validate_fidelity(
            source_envelope,
            output,
            context
        )

    if validation == FAIL:
        reject(output)

    if source_changed_since_pin():
        abort_stale_output()

    attach_provenance(output)

    return output
```

This pseudocode defines conceptual behavior.

It does not claim literal implementation in ChatGPT or any deployed runtime.

---

# 159. Minimum Sufficient Context

CIL should retrieve context fractally.

```text
H — cultural / linguistic domain
        |
        v
M — relevant subsystem
        |
        v
L — specific terminology/context
        |
        v
raw evidence only when required
```

Do not load unrelated cultural information merely because the task involves localization.

---

# 160. CIL Fractal Retrieval

Example:

```text
Need:
translate one AMOS canonical term

H:
target language

M:
technical terminology

L:
specific canonical term

RAW:
authoritative glossary entry if ambiguity remains
```

This is preferable to broad uncontrolled cultural inference.

---

# 161. CIL and RSCF

CIL transformations can be represented as provenance-aware RSCF nodes.

```yaml
RSCF-NODE:

  node_id: CIL

  node_type: universe_canon

  state: SOURCE_CLAIM

  claim_class: AMOS_MODEL

  provenance:
    source: 01_CANON/02_UNIVERSE_CANON

  function:
    - cultural_contextualization
    - linguistic_contextualization
    - localized_semantic_fidelity

  dependencies:
    - source_semantics
    - target_context
    - terminology_mapping

  invalidation_conditions:
    - source_mutation
    - semantic_drift
    - terminology_supersession
    - critical_context_error
```

---

# 162. RSCF Transformation Edge

```text
SOURCE_NODE
     |
     | CIL_LOCALIZES
     v
LOCALIZED_NODE
```

The edge SHOULD carry:

```yaml
edge:

  type: CIL_LOCALIZES

  source_digest: null
  target_digest: null

  source_language: null
  target_language: null

  cultural_context: null

  epoch: null

  receipt: null
```

---

# 163. GMEF Interaction

If CIL detects a material conflict between:

```text
canonical invariant
and
local contextual requirement
```

it should route the conflict rather than silently resolve governance.

Conceptually:

```text
CIL
 |
 v
CONFLICT
 |
 v
GMEF
 |
 v
governed decision
```

The exact GMEF contract depends on authoritative AMOS canon.

---

# 164. Proof-Capsule Reuse

A prior CIL validation may be reused only while:

```text
source digest unchanged
target scope compatible
target regime compatible
terminology valid
context fresh
dependencies valid
no successful falsifier
```

Otherwise revalidation is required.

---

# 165. Local Fast Path

A localization may use a fast path when:

```text
direct mapping exists
canonical terminology is pinned
no material ambiguity exists
scope is stable
no regime crossing occurs
no consequential causal semantics exist
source is fresh
```

Example:

```text
stable date-format localization
```

may not require deep cultural analysis.

---

# 166. Escalation Path

Escalate when:

```text
meaning is ambiguous
concept is culturally non-portable
claim is consequential
legal meaning is involved
causal semantics are involved
historical context matters
canonical terminology conflicts
multiple interpretations compete
source provenance is weak
context is stale
```

---

# 167. Stop Conditions

CIL reasoning may stop when:

```text
Claim Sufficiency:
target meaning is established sufficiently.

Decision Sufficiency:
remaining uncertainty cannot change localization choice.

Action Sufficiency:
output can be safely published within declared scope.
```

Do not continue accumulating cultural background after it ceases to affect the result.

---

# 168. Universe Canon Boundary

CIL is a Universe Canon interface component.

Its role is:

```text
Universe Canon Meaning
        |
        v
CIL
        |
        v
Context-Compatible Representation
```

CIL does not itself determine whether every Universe Canon proposition is empirically true.

Its primary responsibility is preservation of meaning across contextual boundaries.

---

# 169. Source-Established vs Elaborated Boundary

## Source-Established

From the supplied note:

```text
NAME:
CIL Culture Interface Layer

TYPE:
universe_canon

SOURCE:
01_CANON/02_UNIVERSE_CANON

FUNCTION:
Cultural and linguistic contextualization engine

OBJECTIVE:
Localized semantic fidelity
```

## Model-Elaborated in This Reconstruction

The supplied source does not independently establish exact:

```text
CIL algorithms
hash functions
validator implementations
translation engines
cultural datasets
language inventories
confidence formulas
receipt schemas
deployment topology
runtime guarantees
bit-level replay guarantees
governance routing implementation
```

Those remain implementation/model detail unless authoritative canon specifies them.

---

# 170. Known Gaps

The supplied source does not specify:

```yaml
known_gaps:

  - exact definition of the seven Universe Canon layers
  - exact CIL position within those seven layers
  - authoritative CIL input schema
  - authoritative CIL output schema
  - supported language set
  - supported locale set
  - cultural ontology
  - terminology registry
  - validator implementation
  - localization quality metric
  - semantic equivalence threshold
  - conflict-resolution authority
  - cryptographic receipt requirements
  - exact replay contract
  - exact relationship to other Universe Canon nodes
```

These gaps MUST NOT be filled as established canon without authoritative evidence.

---

# 171. Canonical CIL Compact Law

```text
CIL CULTURE INTERFACE LAW

1. PRESERVE MEANING ACROSS CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BOUNDARIES.

2. LOCALIZE REPRESENTATION WITHOUT SILENTLY MUTATING CANON.

3. PRESERVE CLAIM CLASS, UNCERTAINTY, SCOPE, MODALITY,
   CAUSAL STRENGTH, QUANTITIES, AND IDENTITY.

4. PRESERVE CANONICAL TERMS WHEN TRANSLATION WOULD BREAK IDENTITY.

5. EXPOSE NON-PORTABLE CONCEPTS RATHER THAN FABRICATING EQUIVALENCE.

6. PRESERVE COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS WHEN AMBIGUITY CANNOT
   BE RESOLVED.

7. CULTURAL SIMILARITY DOES NOT PROVE SEMANTIC IDENTITY.

8. CULTURAL CONSENSUS DOES NOT PROVE EMPIRICAL TRUTH.

9. MULTIPLE TRANSLATIONS OF ONE SOURCE DO NOT CREATE
   INDEPENDENT PROVENANCE.

10. LOCALIZATION MUST NOT PROMOTE SOURCE_CLAIM TO VERIFIED.

11. LOCALIZATION MUST NOT PROMOTE ASSOCIATION TO CAUSATION.

12. LOCALIZATION MUST NOT REMOVE LOAD-BEARING SCOPE.

13. TARGET CONTEXT MUST BE DECLARED WHEN IT MATERIALLY
    AFFECTS INTERPRETATION.

14. CULTURAL MODELS MUST REMAIN SCOPED AND FRESHNESS-BOUND.

15. INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY MUST NOT BE INFERRED FROM CULTURAL
    OR LINGUISTIC LABELS WITHOUT EVIDENCE.

16. CONSEQUENTIAL TRANSFORMATIONS SHOULD PRESERVE
    PROVENANCE AND VALIDATION RECEIPTS.

17. SOURCE MUTATION INVALIDATES DEPENDENT LOCALIZATIONS
    UNTIL REVALIDATED.

18. HISTORICAL LOCALIZATIONS MUST NOT BE SILENTLY REWRITTEN.

19. CRITICAL SEMANTIC GAPS FAIL CLOSED.

20. INTEGRITY OVERRIDES FLUENCY.

# 174. Final Proof Boundary

> [!warning] Canon Boundary
> The supplied canon establishes CIL as a **cultural and linguistic contextualization engine whose purpose is localized semantic fidelity**.
>
> This reconstruction operationalizes that statement without treating the elaborated mechanisms as independently source-established facts.
>
> In particular, this note does **not** establish that:
>
> * every culture can be represented by a fixed model;
> * perfect cross-cultural semantic equivalence is always possible;
> * translation proves truth;
> * localization creates independent evidence;
> * cultural similarity establishes causal or ontological identity;
> * CIL literally implements any particular software architecture;
> * ChatGPT itself literally implements the runtime mechanisms described here.
>
> Where exact equivalence is unavailable, CIL preserves the gap.

---

# 175. Final Invariant

> [!success] CIL Culture Interface Invariant
>
> **Change the interface as much as necessary to make meaning locally intelligible.**
>
> **Change the underlying meaning no more than the evidence permits.**
>
> Cultural adaptation may transform expression.
>
> Linguistic adaptation may transform form.
>
> Contextualization may add explicitly marked explanation.
>
> None of them may silently manufacture certainty, causation, universality, authority, identity, or canonical truth.
>
> When fidelity and fluency conflict:
>
> **fidelity wins.**
